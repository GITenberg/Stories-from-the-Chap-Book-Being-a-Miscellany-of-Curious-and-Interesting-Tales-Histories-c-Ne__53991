      WHITHER THOU GOEST

      By Katharine Bates

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE wind stirred
      the tops of the maple trees in the Quinsby front yard, and the old man who
      stood on the steps, watching the shadows and the moonlight, sighed as he
      heard the soft rustling sound. He glanced back into the house, through the
      hall, into the bedroom, where his wife was lighting a candle preparatory
      to turning down the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll jest step down there a minit,&rdquo; he
      whispered to himself, and hurriedly but softly went down the steps. Far
      down in a corner of the yard, near the front fence, a hammock hung between
      two small pin oaks, and it was here the old man went, looking back
      uneasily now and then, as if he expected a call from his wife. The hammock
      was an old one, and had evidently hung there all summer, for the meshes
      were torn and all the gay colors had faded to a dingy gray. It tossed
      lightly in the breeze as the wind grew stronger, and the old man&rsquo;s
      hand trembled as he caught at its swaying folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; he whispered softly, &ldquo;are you both here? Are
      you pushing the swing, Winnie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flutter went over the leaves of a lilac bush near, and he turned
      quickly to it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Nan&rsquo;s laugh-gigglin&rsquo; at
      yore old pa jest as usual, Nanny girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; his wife called from the porch, &ldquo;you better
      come in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and hurried back to her. She stood on the steps with the candle
      still in her hand, its tiny flame looking almost blue in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe a storm is cornin&rsquo; up and you&rsquo;ll ketch cold,&rdquo;
      she said when he reached her. Her voice was stern, but the look in her
      gray eyes was as sad as the trembling of his lips when he said to her,
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it jest the sorter night the girls use&rsquo; to beg to
      stay out, and not have to go to bed yet a while?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty pretty night,&rdquo; she answered. She followed
      him into their room, closing the hall door after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t shet it, Mira, don&rsquo;t! It seems as if you was
      shettin&rsquo; the children out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quinsby turned to him. &ldquo;Hiram, I must speak out to you,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any more&rsquo;n you why the Lord
      thought best to take our girls, our two good, pretty girls, but He has
      done it, and it ain&rsquo;t right for you to be lettin&rsquo; yoreself
      fancy you hear &lsquo;em &lsquo;round on nights like this. I&rsquo;ve
      faith to believe if we can keep ourselves outer sin for the rest of our
      days we shall see the children again&mdash;but not here, Hiram, not here
      in the old place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it ain&rsquo;t Nan and Winnie sure &lsquo;nough,&rdquo;
      Hiram answered apologetically, &ldquo;but these nights make me think of
      &lsquo;em a terrible lot&mdash;and the leaves goin&rsquo; so and so in the
      wind does sound real like Nan&rsquo;s laugh. Mira, I was out in the garden
      while you was puttin&rsquo; the dishes away and strainin&rsquo; the milk,
      and jest as the moon came out and the wind started up I heard a laugh like
      Nan&rsquo;s, and then something danced by me that must have been Winnie. I
      hurried down the path after it, and there by the poppy bed were the girls,
      rompin&rsquo; jest like children again, &lsquo;most grown girls that they
      are. As the wind came up more they laughed again, not so soft as they had
      been doin&rsquo;, but a real burst of gay laughin&rsquo; like they use&rsquo;
      to work themselves up to, and then they ran towards the arbor and peeped
      out from the honeysuckle, and Nan called, &lsquo;Here, Pa,&rsquo; and
      Winnie sorter sang out, &lsquo;Father, Father,&rsquo; in her soft way.&rdquo;
      Mrs. Quinsby put her hands on his shoulders and gave him a little shake.
      Her eyes were frightened, and her voice came quick and stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are doin&rsquo; yoreself
      an injury. The girls are in heaven, not here, and don&rsquo;t you let go
      yore grip on yore mind. Think of me, Hiram&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got me left,
      and I can&rsquo;t stand the thought of the lonesomeness if you let your
      senses go. You and me have been married so many years, Hiram, we could n&rsquo;t
      get on without each other. Why, it seems to me the good Lord would surely
      let me get foolish too&mdash;mebbe it ain&rsquo;t fittin&rsquo; for one of
      my years to say it, but I&rsquo;d ruther, yes, I&rsquo;d <i>ruther</i> if
      it comes down to choosin&rsquo; between my senses and you, Hiram!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The far-away look disappeared from Hiram&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I was jest
      thinkin&rsquo;, Mira,&rdquo; he said reassuringly. &ldquo;It was only that
      the night was so powerful pretty. But now we won&rsquo;t talk of the
      children any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quinsby drew him back to the porch again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me hard, Father,&rdquo; she said entreatingly,
      &ldquo;but I want you to be sure. Look over there towards the church; you
      can see the dark heap of trees against the sky in the churchyard, can&rsquo;t
      you? There&rsquo;s where the girls are&mdash;there&rsquo;s where they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, Mira. Though how the Lord could take those pretty
      young things, and our only two, that had come to us when we was long past
      hopin&rsquo;, is more&rsquo;n I can see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to bed, but later in the night Mrs. Quinsby waked suddenly. Her
      first thought was that the storm was really coming and she had left the
      pantry windows open. She slipped out of bed, but as she realized that her
      movement did not disturb her husband, a blind terror came over her; she
      struck match after match before she could make herself believe he was not
      there. Then she picked up a shawl and flung it over her nightgown, and,
      regardless of her bare feet, rushed out to the garden. The wind was
      blowing hard and the moon was half hidden by the lightly scudding clouds,
      but Hiram&rsquo;s laugh&mdash;the pleased, indulgent laugh that his girls&rsquo;
      nonsense had so often produced&mdash;guided her to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Mother?&rdquo; he called as she ran down the path.
      &ldquo;What a couple of colts you&rsquo;ve brought up, Mira. Reckon you
      could find their beat anywheres in Mizzourer for friskiness? Just see
      those girls racin&rsquo; round&mdash;a storm comin&rsquo; up always did go
      to their heads. Hear Nan laugh! Ain&rsquo;t she the greatest girl for
      foolin&rsquo; you ever saw?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to some tall hollyhocks that she could see were bending low
      with the wind, and added, &ldquo;Watch her bow; Nan was always as easy
      movin&rsquo; in her body as a saplin&rsquo; or a tall flower.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quinsby put her arm around his shoulder. &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s let go&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      let go, Father, and I&rsquo;m left! I can&rsquo;t stand the lonesomeness,
      I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved toward the arbor. As they passed under the drooping
      honeysuckle, Hiram laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are putting their hands over our eyes to make us guess which
      is which&mdash;the little geese!&rdquo; Mrs. Quinsby put her hand to her
      forehead and pressed the cool honeysuckle leaves against her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed too. &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I knew the
      Almighty would let me go with him. He knew how it was with Hiram and me.&rdquo;
      Aloud she said, &ldquo;I guess Winnie. Yore hands ain&rsquo;t as soft as
      Winnie&rsquo;s, Nan.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      AN IMPASSABLE GULF
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Katharine Bates
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER ELSTON&rsquo;S
      two nieces, Nancy Rollins and Hester Elston, stood on opposite sides of
      the frame, working together silently. Suddenly Hester dropped her needle,
      straightened her lithe young figure, and throwing back her pretty head,
      said hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can feel so, Nan! You must see how good
      he is, as well as bein&rsquo; different from any boy we&rsquo;ve ever
      known round here on the Prairie. Ain&rsquo;t he always thoughtful &lsquo;bout
      pleasin&rsquo; Uncle Peter? And he&rsquo;s gone to church reg&rsquo;lar
      with us every Sunday he&rsquo;s been here, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She pauses, catching her breath after her eager speech, and looking
      yearningly at Nancy. The older girl&rsquo;s pale face hardened as she
      caught the imploring glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to me to be very worldly,&rdquo; she said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color rushed to Hester&rsquo;s cheeks, and she bent quickly over the
      frame; for a few moments she sewed vigorously, saying to herself with
      fierce indignation, as she worked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare if I think Nancy is so spiritual, after all&mdash;a
      judgin&rsquo; Fred like that, and all because he told her he liked to go
      now and then to the the-<i>a</i>-tre!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Resentment, however, never lingered long in Hester&rsquo;s heart, and at
      last she raised her head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you did feel different, Nan,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t bear to think of you not takin&rsquo; to the man I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; to marry. You and me have always seemed jest like sisters ever
      since Uncle Pete took us to raise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s blue eyes met the pleading brown ones more gently this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;you <i>have</i> been jest like
      a sister to me, Hetty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hester ran around the frame and threw her arms around her cousin with the
      eager expression of affection which always embarrassed Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nan,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I jest do wish you could see it the
      way I do. Fred is so good, and it&rsquo;s only because he lives in town
      that he has gotten to like such things as the-<i>a</i>-tres. You do take
      to him sure &lsquo;nough, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s voice quivered as she answered the passionate appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s got pleasant ways, and he&rsquo;s right
      principled about a lot of things, but, Hetty, there&rsquo;s no denyin&rsquo;
      he puts pleasure before servin&rsquo; the Lord, and we are told mighty
      plain in the Bible not to make friends with the Mammon of unrighteousness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hester bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some folks, and real good ones, too, who think havin&rsquo;
      some pleasures like Fred cares for and bein&rsquo; real down good
      Christians, too, ain&rsquo;t incompatible,&rdquo; she said, struggling to
      speak calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gulf,&rdquo; Nancy said firmly, &ldquo;between me
      and the-<i>a</i>-tre goers, and I&rsquo;m mighty sorry for you, Hester.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; cried Hester, impatiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      happy and satisfied about marryin&rsquo; Fred!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this talk about marryin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Uncle Peter
      called in at the doorway, as he paused to wave his bundle of birds and
      squirrels at his nieces. &ldquo;Jest leave a couple of girls alone, and
      their tongues are sure to get to waggin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout marryin&rsquo;!
      Come along, Hetty, and help me pick and clean this lot. It&rsquo;s been a
      fine huntin&rsquo; day, if &lsquo;tis a trifle coldish for an old man like
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old!&rdquo; laughed Hester, as they settled themselves by the
      kitchen fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am gettin&rsquo; on,&rdquo; cried Uncle Peter, seriously,
      &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see how I am goin&rsquo; to do without you,
      Hester. You are sure you want to marry Fred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sure,&rdquo; said Hester, quickly. &ldquo;Uncle Pete, wasn&rsquo;t
      it jest marvellous for him to fall in love with me, when he&rsquo;s a town
      man and knows such a lot of girls with better manners and all that?&rdquo;
      Uncle Peter looked meditatively at the delicate rose complexion, the large
      brown eyes, and the soft, waving hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see as it was so dreadful queer,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d pass in a crowd, Het.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a little while, Hester dreaming happy dreams of her
      future, and Uncle Peter groaning inwardly at the prospect of being left to
      live alone with the more spiritual of his nieces. Suddenly a gleam of hope
      came to him, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe you can&rsquo;t marry him after all&mdash;town folks have a
      great way of not makin&rsquo; a livin&rsquo;, Hetty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; admitted Hester, almost despondently, but her
      face brightened as she added; &ldquo;but it is such a great big store Fred
      is clerkin&rsquo; in that I&rsquo;m jest sure we won&rsquo;t have to wait
      long, Uncle Pete.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiting time proved to be as short as Hester and Fred had hoped, for
      in spite of his &ldquo;worldliness&rdquo; Fred was a faithful young
      fellow, and the promotion which made possible a tiny flat, and
      housekeeping on a limited scale, came even before he had expected it.
      Uncle Peter did his best to be cheery at the simple little wedding, and
      Nancy had baked as many cakes for them as if the young couple were not
      starting out on a sinful career. Hester prized keenly the expressions of
      affection which had been rare up to the time when her uncle and cousin had
      realized what a difference her going would make in their lives, and her
      grief at leaving her home amazed and almost annoyed Fred, who had grown to
      look upon himself as her deliverer from a life which seemed very cramped
      and hard to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish there was somethin&rsquo; I could do for you, Hetty,&rdquo;
      Uncle Peter said, when the last of the wedding guests had departed, and he
      and Nancy were hurrying Fred and Hester away to the train, for they were
      going at once to their new home. He took her carpet-bag from her, and
      awkwardly helped her to button the linen duster, which Nancy had insisted
      should be worn to the station to protect the new travelling dress from the
      mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; said Hester, tremulously. &ldquo;Uncle Pete, if
      you could jest make Nancy see that goin&rsquo; to the the-<i>a</i>-tre ain&rsquo;t
      incompatible with goin&rsquo; to Heaven some day, I &lsquo;d be greatly
      obliged to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Peter drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a sight of work here, Hetty,&rdquo; he said
      tenderly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been dreadful fond of you, too, but I&rsquo;ll
      be damned if I will try to get a new notion into Nancy&rsquo;s head, even
      for you!&rdquo; Hester sighed. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it would be askin&rsquo;
      a good deal of you,&rdquo; she said simply &ldquo;but, Uncle Pete, you
      will remind her anyway that Fred and I won&rsquo;t be able to afford goin&rsquo;
      more&rsquo;n once in a long, long time, won&rsquo;t you? Now good-bye,
      Uncle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped her into the wagon, and while Fred and Nancy were crossing the
      yard, he stood looking at her with his lips twitching nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Hester,&rdquo; Nancy said, climbing up on the step of the
      wagon. The two kissed each other, and Hester clung for a second to her
      cousin&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nan,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;we have always played
      together and done our work together&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;t</i> feel hard to
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked down at her sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a mite hard,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
      judgin&rsquo;, Hetty, only there&rsquo;s a gulf. Goodbye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Fred and held out her hand. &ldquo;I wish you well,&rdquo;
      she said, in her clear, calm tones, and then she opened the yard gate and
      stood inside, leaving Uncle Peter a chance for his farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrung Fred&rsquo;s hand, but no words came from his trembling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be very good to her,&rdquo; Fred said hurriedly. &ldquo;Good-bye,
      sir. I hope you won&rsquo;t mind if I say I consider it an honor to be
      your nephew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time Uncle Peter grasped only the first words. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;be good to her, Fred&mdash;she&rsquo;s a good girl, a good
      girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped on the hub of the wheel, and Hester threw her arms around him,
      kissing vehemently his gray head and wrinkled cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget me,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Oh, how can I
      leave you and Nan and the old place? Goodbye, and I love you, I do so love
      you, Uncle Pete!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from Nancy the hired man whipped up the horses. As they drove
      away Hester looked back at the clump of oak-trees around the house, and
      then at the two figures at the yard gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d done more for&rsquo;em all these years they&rsquo;ve
      been so good to me,&rdquo; she said, the tears streaming down her cheeks.
      Fred held her hand close between both of his, but he made no answer, for
      her grief dazed him. He knew that many elements in her life had been
      distasteful to her; and why should a woman who was marrying the man she
      loved, and was moreover going to town to live, grieve in this way? The
      hired man turned in his seat and gave the needed word of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a sight for&rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said warmly,
      &ldquo;and you ain&rsquo;t no cause to fret, Miss Hetty. We&rsquo;ll all
      miss you terrible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Peter wandered restlessly around the farm until dinner-time. An
      aching heart was a new experience to him, and one that he did not know how
      to meet. He went into the orchard and picked up apple after apple, and
      after a mere taste flung each of them away; as he left the orchard he
      stopped to look back at the mass of Spanish needle and goldenrod, through
      which he had just made his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How she did like all that yeller stuff,&rdquo; he said aloud.
      &ldquo;What a sight of interest she took in everything about the place.
      She was a good girl, and I wish I&rsquo;d a quit swearin&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;twould
      have tickled her mightily. Hanged if I don&rsquo;t quit it now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy had an unusually good dinner ready for him. Preparing it had helped
      her to pass the morning, for Uncle Peter&rsquo;s was not the only aching
      heart. She helped him lavishly to half a dozen vegetables, but for the
      first time within her memory of him, he had no appetite. He pushed back
      his chair before she brought his pie, and as he did so a sudden wave of
      antagonism to her came over him; he had never spoken to her of her stern
      words to Hester, but now involuntarily his criticism of her slipped from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed if I can see how you could have been so hard on Fred, and
      let pore Hetty go away feelin&rsquo; so broke up,&rdquo; he said
      impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy pressed her lips together firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never judged Fred himself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I always
      separated the sin from the sinner, and we are bidden to be unceasing in
      denouncing sin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Peter said no more; he rose from the table and went out to the
      porch, and as he sat there Fred&rsquo;s words recurred to him, and roused
      a glow of affectionate feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud to be my nephew,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine
      feller, he is, and Hetty&rsquo;s done well for herself, if it is pretty
      hard on us to be left.&rdquo; He went back to the dining-room, where Nancy
      was clearing the dishes away, and opening the door he called in
      vehemently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blamed if I care if he takes her to the the-<i>a</i>-tre every
      night in the week!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy turned a startled face to him, forgetful of the fact that tears were
      rolling down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected sight of her grief touched her uncle keenly; he had never
      before seen her cry, and going over to her and laying his hand on her
      shoulder, he said affectionately, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reg&rsquo;lar old
      brute, Nan. You must excuse me, and remember it&rsquo;s losin&rsquo; Hetty
      that&rsquo;s sorter upset me. I orter be better &lsquo;n usual to you,
      instead of meaner, for I can see you are grievin&rsquo; too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have more cause to be grievin&rsquo; even than you, Uncle Peter,&rdquo;
      Nancy said sadly, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s an impassable gulf between
      Hetty and me now.&rdquo; Uncle Peter&rsquo;s hand slipped from her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gulfs be damned,&rdquo; he said impatiently.

    <h2>
      IN A GARDEN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Neith Boyce
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>VER the wall of
      the Mission, against the glowing west, the tops of the trees flickered in
      the wind from the sea, shot through with level glancing arrows of clear
      light. The sky was all astir with little soft, gold-tipped clouds. To the
      languid hush of the hot day had succeeded a subtle animation like the
      smile on the lips of a sleeping woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this awakening air the last organ-notes of the vesper service died
      away, and were echoed by the slow, rhythmic swing of the tall
      eucalyptus-trees. The rustle of the leaves imitated the sound of the
      devout dispersing from the chapel; and a magnolia shook out from its great
      white chalices an incense more penetrating than any wafted before the
      altar. Suddenly all this gentle derision seemed to voice itself in a burst
      of mocking laughter, faint and far away, like the airy merriment of elves.
      The sound approached and grew louder, running through the notes of a
      treble scale. And the trees in the monks&rsquo; garden seemed to bend and
      listen and to beckon while they shook all over with malicious glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scurrying over the ground beyond, with bare, dusty feet, appeared a group
      of creatures pulling each other by extended arms, or brown garments which
      seemed a part of the earth, or by their braids of strong, black hair. Writhing
      in this rough play they flung themselves against the wall. A palefaced
      girl in a scarlet blouse, like a cactus-flower bursting from its dull
      sheath, threw up her arms into the dense, dark foliage of an overhanging
      fig-tree and dragged down the bough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are ripe!&mdash;what did I tell you?&rdquo; she cried, as at a
      touch a purple, bloomy fig fell into her hand. She tore it open and
      fastened her teeth, sharp and white as those of a squirrel, in the pink
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companions hung back, looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are caught&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care? Cowards! There&mdash;now you can put all the blame
      on me. Eat, then, little pigs that you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heavy-lidded eyes were cold and contemptuously smiling. Hanging to the
      bough with both hands, she shook it roughly, and the ripe figs fell in a
      shower, some flattening to pulp on the ground. The girls flung themselves
      down, and, chattering, gathered the unspoiled fruit into the skirts of
      their gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true; they are better than ours,&rdquo; cried one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust the holy fathers to have the best,&rdquo; added another,
      lowering her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They taste better,&rdquo; said Fiora, the tall girl in the scarlet
      blouse, &ldquo;because we are stealing them.&rdquo; And she licked her red
      lips with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be better ones higher up,&rdquo; said a fourth,
      greedily, standing with her hands on her broad hips and her head thrown
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; responded Fiora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she caught hold of the drooping branch, drew herself up, and in an
      instant the thick foliage hid her from sight. Her companions,
      half-smothered with laughter, besought her to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you are seen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch!&rdquo; cried Fiora.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rain of soft bodies fell, thumping them about the shoulders. Through the
      parted leaves an impudent face looked down, framed like a young faun&rsquo;s
      in living green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going higher&mdash;I am going to look into the garden!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; in frightened and delighted chorus. &ldquo;You dare
      not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my children,&rdquo; said Fiora, condescendingly. &ldquo;They
      say no woman has ever seen this garden. Well, I have a great mind to be
      the first!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying along the thick branch, she listened smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is forbidden!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be punished!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The holy fathers&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have they in their garden,&rdquo; she cried at last, &ldquo;that
      is so sacred that we may not see it? Would our feet soil the grass or the
      paths?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked at one another slyly and hid their faces; and their
      malicious laughter, stifled with difficulty and uncontrollable, mingled
      again with the eager murmurs of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiora, herself laughing, she scarcely knew why, disappeared, the leaves
      closing behind her like a green sea. She crept along the great branch
      until her feet found something firm&mdash;the top of the wall. Clinging to
      the trunk of the tree which leaned against this wall, she tried to pierce
      the thick layers of foliage below her, but in vain; nothing was to be seen
      in the garden. She swore softly. Then, in trying to extend herself upon a
      branch which projected into the garden, she slipped, catching vainly at
      the nearest twigs, and with a thrill of alarm came to her feet upon the
      forbidden soil. She clenched her hands, full of bruised leaves, against
      her breast, as she crouched in the shelter of the drooping boughs.
      Startled by the noise of her fall, her companions took flight like a covey
      of birds, with a rustle, a faint murmur&mdash;silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiora sank to her knees and remained for some moments motionless, gazing
      out into the garden. In the dusk, deepened by the shadow of encircling
      trees, nothing was visible save narrow paths strewn with opal-colored
      sea-shells glimmering amid fresh turf, and roses blooming in masses along
      these walks and hiding the wall under their heavy leaves, thick with
      flowers like pale flames. Silence&mdash;except for the applauding whisper
      of the trees and the plash of water. There was no one in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking courage, the intruder pushed her way out from under the boughs of
      the fig-tree. The freshly sprinkled grass caressed her feet. The perfume
      of the roses and the magnolia blossoms, becoming more intense as the dew
      began to gather, surrounded her like an invisible presence, seeming to
      draw her on. She stole softly forward, her eyes alert for the least
      warning and alive with curiosity. The path led her through an arbor
      drifted deep with the perfumed snow of wistaria, and between banks of
      golden pansies set in mosaic borders. At the intersection of this gleaming
      streak with another a fountain played in a white basin, tossing high in
      the air a crystal ball. The crest of the plume of water caught a gleam of
      golden light, and the transparent ball glittered as it rose every instant
      from shadow. Fiora paused to watch it and to follow the arrowy glidings of
      the gold-fish in the basin. The short southern twilight was already ended.
      It was now dark&mdash;the hour at which the fathers took their evening
      meal. Yielding, therefore, to her fancy, she followed the windings of the
      paths, stopping recklessly to pluck now a scarlet pomegranate, which she
      ate with puckered lips; now a rose, crimson or yellow, or a long spray of
      white roses with pink hearts, set close together on the stem. Huge cacti,
      their gray, distorted bodies spotted with blood-colored blossoms, stood
      here and there in clumps. Banana trees waved softly their long, graceful
      fronds. The wind stirred with a dry rustle among palms with broad trunks
      and large fans, and others, slender and lofty, with crests like stacked
      swords, and among masses of pampas-grass tufted with great white plumes.
      Along the wall, to which now and then Fiora&rsquo;s wanderings in the
      confined space brought her, grew apricot and peach trees heavy with ripe
      fruit. These perfect sweets also she tasted capriciously and threw away
      half-eaten. The place exerted a strange influence over her. The hour, the
      delicious thrill of danger, the heavy perfumes, intoxicated her. It seemed
      that the trees bent toward her to murmur something, that the pale faces of
      the flowers held some mysterious message. They looked friendly; they
      appeared to smile knowingly at her, to encourage her, to urge her on.
      Vaguely she felt all this breathing, eager life a part of her, belonging
      to her. She threw back her head, turning it from side to side with an air
      of satisfied possession, drawing in the cool air through her nostrils and
      parted lips with sensuous delight&mdash;this pale creature whose eyes
      showed a savage response to the cajoling beauty about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Convinced at last that the garden held no secret, save that of certain
      flowers and fruits cultivated to unknown perfection,&mdash;for she had
      explored it from the limiting wall to where the pallid outline of some
      building of the Mission gleamed through the trees,&mdash;she came back to
      the fountain and sat down on the wooden bench at the path&rsquo;s edge,
      her flowers heaped in her lap. She gave herself a few moments more to
      watch the leaping ball, which now sparkled like silver in the midst of
      glittering spray. A shaft of moonlight, striking through the trees upon
      the jet of water, crept steadily downward. The girl, her eyes fixed on
      this trembling column of white fire and foam, fell in a vague, trance-like
      dream. The ripple of the fountain in her ears drowned the echo of slow
      footsteps advancing along the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Father Anselmo&rsquo;s custom, while digesting his supper of meat
      pasty and chocolate, to pace the garden, whose beauty seldom failed to
      inspire him with poetical images, and to add each evening some dozen lines
      to his panegyric ode on Saint Francis. Anselmo was, in fact, a poet,&mdash;but
      a poet whose strictly regulated fancy never openly strayed beyond the
      confines of the cloister. His gentle muse sang consecrated themes alone.
      And if, surrounded by an indolent, veiled fervor of tropical nature, apt
      to long, arid trances, and to sudden outbursts of fierce luxuriance, his
      imagination was sometimes troubled, these secret vagaries were repressed
      or found no acknowledged utterance. In his black, shapeless robe, above
      which his placid face showed like a sickly moon, the father, whether
      meditating on the pasty or Saint Francis, seemed no prey to the poetic
      ardor; its afflatus left him undizzied and peaceful. Yet the mystery of
      the night, the garden&rsquo;s magic, must have struck some responsive
      chord within him. For how else should his bodily eyes have beheld beneath
      the shadow of the acacia bushes a creature not human, surely not divine;
      no spiritual vision, but an apparition born of the earth and evil. It sat
      half-visible, buried to the chin in flowers, motionless, its face a mere
      pale shimmer, its great shadowy eyes fixed upon him. These eyes were
      terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anselmo retreated some steps upon their discovery; then, after much
      hesitation, advanced again, extending the cross of his rosary and
      muttering with trembling lips certain words of proved potency. But neither
      holy symbol nor exorcism availed against the evil spirit. It refused to
      flee; sat dumb&mdash;it seemed to Anselmo disdainful. Suddenly, wrathful,
      he took another step forward; the creature drew in its breath sharply,
      with an audible sound; its lips parted, showing a row of gleaming teeth.
      Anselmo paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, he perceived, the spirit of the garden, and it was plainly
      hostile. Was he, then, the intruder? Vaguely a sense of helpless fright
      invaded his soul. Yes, the trees were in league with this being; they bent
      towards him threateningly! The air was full of veiled alarms. What of the
      rosebushes which even now reached out clutching hands to detain him? An
      overblown white rose broke and fell in a soft shower about his shoulders,
      and he started; a bat swooped down with swift, filmy wings, just grazing
      his head; he shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be that he was in danger, that his wandering thoughts were known,
      that his sinful fancies had thus taken shape to confound him? Anselmo
      crossed himself. It was true&mdash;moved by the garden&rsquo;s spell he
      had sometime in reverie invoked the animating principle of this beauty of
      earth, which he knew well was soulless and evil&mdash;and behold it
      incarnate!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the apparition did not menace him overtly, perhaps it felt his
      spiritual armor proof. Nevertheless, it was his part to fly possible
      danger, to deliver over the unhallowed domain to its true possessor. What
      part had he in these caresses of the breeze, these wooings of flowers,
      these marriages of insects, this glamour of nocturnal magic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing, as he did, the evil power of the moon at its full, how had he
      been persuaded to walk in debatable ground where that demoniac glory,
      rising warm and wanton above the trees, could mock and threaten him? Under
      the branches of the acacia the shadow sat still in deeper shadow; save
      that the rays of the moon fell upon two slim, naked feet, which the short
      grass could not cover. It had taken, then, the form of a woman, that the
      garden and its tradition might be doubly desecrated! Anselmo&rsquo;s
      indignation was not fierce enough to nerve his soul, weakened by mystic
      terrors. He turned to fly, but, instead, uttered an exclamation, calling
      in a trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Emanuel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another black robe, another pale face, appeared beside him, and, like him,
      started back at perceiving the strange figure. After consultation in
      whispers the bolder monk approached the acacia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no spirit, Brother Anselmo&mdash;it is a woman!&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman! How could a woman get into the garden?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first speaker cast a troubled glance in the direction of the high
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; he said uncertainly. &ldquo;Still it must be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But involuntarily he moved a step nearer his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both glanced down at the slender feet in the grass. These seemed to move,
      and the spirit, or woman, turned her head swiftly from side to side. Her
      breath came quicker, but the monks could not hear it, or they might have
      taken courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is astonishing,&rdquo; murmured Brother Emanuel, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they stood undecided between the attack and the retreat, suddenly
      from the chapel near by the organ gave voice in a deep, swelling chord,
      which climbed by subtle and suave modulations and soared aloft into a
      tender melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Brother Angelo,&rdquo; whispered Anselmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is holy music!&rdquo; said Emanuel, devoutly, and he made the
      sign of the cross in the air before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tremulous notes, growing louder, drowned the rustle of the leaves, the
      plash of the fountain, the sigh of the wind. It seemed as though the
      garden hushed half-unwillingly to listen, when a voice, humanly deep and
      sweet, but spiritualized into something not less than divine, took up the
      melody and bore it higher and heavenward, pouring out into the night a
      flood of ecstasy and aspiration. The march of the music was solemn and
      splendid, and its soul was a joy unearthly and beyond utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black-robed brothers stood and listened, rebuked and dumb, turning
      their faces toward the glimmering wall of the chapel, and forgetting for a
      moment the fears which had agitated them, with their cause. What were all
      the potencies of the passionate earth, so easily diverted from good,
      against this royal dominion?
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil-seeming spell was broken. A sudden movement, no sound but a
      stirring of the air, recalled their attention. The foliage of the acacia
      trembled as though a bird had taken wing. The bench was vacant, flowers
      strewed the ground before it, the presence had vanished. Her white feet or
      a breath of air had borne her away. The diapason of the organ drowned the
      sound her flight might have made; and the trees bent as though to bury in
      shadow her possible path. Emanuel made a long step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman or spirit, she is gone!&rdquo; he cried, and stooped to see
      what trace of her those scattered roses might show. Anselmo grasped his
      companion&rsquo;s sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not touch them,&rdquo; he entreated, glancing fearfully over his
      shoulder. &ldquo;Who knows what spell is upon them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      True, when found next morning, withered and scentless, these flowers
      appeared commonplace enough. Nor did there exist other proof that on this
      spot two brothers of the order had beheld a strange and dangerous vision.
      None the less was their sober account accepted implicitly by the brethren,
      of whom the wiser ever thereafter avoided to walk in the garden at the
      moon&rsquo;s full; though certain of the more youthful were known to
      adventure themselves at that place and season.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not recorded that their daring and zeal met with any reward or
      recognition. Nor, perhaps, is this to be wondered at. For if any wandering
      spirit, coveting, yet not daring to enter the garden, had strayed near to
      the confining wall, it must have heard daily the solemn chant of the
      Church&rsquo;s exorcism directed against all powers unholy; it must daily
      have beheld a slow procession of monks make the circuit of the
      shell-strewn paths, sprinkling the ground with holy-water to purify it
      from the contaminating touch of a woman&rsquo;s foot. And if, spirit or
      woman, it were still undeterred, there was Angelo&rsquo;s music at evening&mdash;like
      another flaming sword at the gate of this Eveless Eden!

      ORESTE&rsquo;S PATRON
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Grace Ellery Channing
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Signore
      Americano, musing over his morning coffee on the Villa terrace, gazed
      intently into the distance where Florence lay invisible behind the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buon&rsquo; giorno, Signore!&rdquo; called Oreste, reining in
      Elisabetta and lifting his cap with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buon&rsquo; giorno!&rdquo; returned the Signore, starting. &ldquo;Ah,
      you are going to the city, and I wanted to go myself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oreste looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signore,&mdash;how much I am sorry! It displeases me, but I am
      already promised to my patron. When one is poor, one must think of the
      francs for the family,&rdquo; he added apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore, who knew no such necessity, frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the fifth time this Carnivale&mdash;and you just married!
      If I had a <i>sposina</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Signore&rsquo;s <i>sposina</i> would lack for nothing,&rdquo;
      smiled Oreste. &ldquo;We others,&mdash;we must do as we can. As for Gioja,
      she goes to pass the day with her <i>nonna</i> at Vincigliata. I will
      bring the Signore&rsquo;s mail as usual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore waved his hand impatiently, and knocked the ashes from his
      cigarette, then, as the shabby cab, with Elisabetta pulling heroically
      back against the steepness, wound from sight, his glance softened. It was
      a piece of fortune surely for a Vignola cabman to have a city patron.
      Fortunes were not to be made up here where nobody but the <i>forestieri</i>,
      who came from time to time to make a <i>villegiatura</i> in one or another
      of the villas, would think of wasting francs for the sole purpose of
      getting somewhere. The inhabitants stayed where they found themselves
      placed by Providence. To all intents, Vignola might be a hundred miles
      from Florence instead of a bare six. Besides, a stranger Signore passes
      with the season, but a city patron remains. Nuisance as it was to have his
      own plans conflicted with, the Signore forgave Oreste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes later this melting mood congealed again, as a slender
      figure stole quietly down the Way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Gioja, walking with her usual listless grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her small head, its crisply waved Tuscan hair bound with a kerchief of
      dull blue, was carried far back as no kerchiefed head has a right to be;
      and her eyes, blue as the kerchief but not dull, looked straight ahead,
      dilated and musing. She did not see the Signore,&mdash;a thing that could
      have befallen no other girl in the village, unless it were blind Chiara,
      and the Signore watched her go with a frown,&mdash;for this was not the
      direction of Vincigliata. And why was she starting so early, unless to
      defeat the glances with which all these closed doors would soon be alive?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he continued to watch her. There were other girls in the village just
      as pretty. Many a strain of noble blood had gone to the making of these
      Vignolese peasants. This was not the first girl the Signore had seen who
      looked as if&mdash;change her gown and tie a bonnet over her hair&mdash;she
      might loll in her carriage of an afternoon at the Cascine with the best of
      the fine ladies in the city below. But there was no other whom the Signore
      ever leaned over the wall to look after. And as he leaned his frown
      deepened; he was sorry for Oreste; but&mdash;marry a girl like that and
      leave her alone, in Italy! Anybody might foresee the end. And he frowned
      again, not at Gioja this time, who had disappeared from view, but at a
      mental image, wearing, it is true, an air dangerously like that of Oreste&rsquo;s
      <i>sposa</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed, anybody might foretell the end. That was what the whole
      community, already buzzing with the scandal, said. And it was exactly what
      the Padre said when, five minutes later, he came up the path and sank upon
      the marble seat, mopping his brow beneath the beaver hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to Oreste&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said apologetically,
      &ldquo;and thought I would look in upon the Signore in passing. There was
      nobody there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore, engaged in pouring red wine for his guest, made no response,
      and the priest stole a troubled glance at him as he took the glass from
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, Signore, you may have seen them pass, and can tell me if
      that child went with her husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Signore, after a minute&rsquo;s deliberation,
      &ldquo;I could not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His guest sighed as he sipped the wine. He had grown gray in the service
      of the village. He had known Gioja from her babyhood. His was the hand
      which had held and oiled and dipped her at the font, and had led her from
      then until her present estate; and he, if any one, had a right to borrow
      trouble, seeing that all troubles were brought to him in the end. His
      fine, thin lips shut above the wineglass in the sensitive line which marks
      the better of Rome&rsquo;s two types. His soul was straight and simple.
      The one vanity it owned was to be on terms of companionship with the
      occupant of the big villa. The half hour on its terrace or in its salotto
      formed his social dissipation, and dearly did he prize the importance it
      gave him in the eyes of his flock. Nay, it gave importance to the whole
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not every village has a priest like ours,&rdquo; said the gossips,
      complacently, &ldquo;that a so-educated stranger Signore would make so
      much of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if his people were poor, God alone knows how poor their priest
      was, and the Signore possessed a fine taste in wines,&mdash;true Chianti,
      a very different thing from <i>vino rosso</i> at eighty centesimi the
      flask,&mdash;while his lavishness was that of his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Signore, he would pour the oil from a fresh flask any time to
      unseal the lips pressed together as now over the case of Oreste&rsquo;s <i>sposa</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; sighed the priest, &ldquo;the end is too easy
      to foresee. The child is not like others; and there is nothing worse than
      that. That&rsquo;s what Luigi&rsquo;s <i>sposa</i> said yesterday when I
      rebuked her for thinking evil, and recalled to her how Gioja helped nurse
      her three through the fever only last spring. &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not
      saying she has n&rsquo;t a heart,&rsquo; said Luigi&rsquo;s <i>sposa</i>;
      &lsquo;but you can&rsquo;t deny that all is not right when a girl is
      different from all the rest; it is better to have less heart and be more
      like one&rsquo;s neighbors.&rsquo; And Luigi&rsquo;s wife had reason.
      Nothing is worse than to be different from all the folk about you. When I
      had her safely married, I thought indeed there would be an end of trouble;&mdash;Heaven
      grant it do not prove a beginning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she not love her husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; sighed the priest, impatiently. &ldquo;Oreste
      is not one to set the Arno afire, but he is a good lad. But about her he
      is a mule,&mdash;a very mule. Would you believe, Signore, when I ventured
      a word,&mdash;I, whose duty it is,&mdash;he flared up like a Befana torch,&mdash;he
      whose manner to me ordinarily is a lesson to the community!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore smiled and reflected upon the strength of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would say I had spoken ill of the Saints,&rdquo; continued the
      exasperated priest. &ldquo;And the thing is becoming insufferable,&mdash;such
      a tale of scandal as some one whispers to me every day. One would think
      she has neither eyes nor ears, and cares not whether she has friends or
      foes for neighbors.&rdquo; There is, in truth, no such broad and flowery
      path to unpopularity as this which Gioja undeviatingly pursued. Nobody who
      elects to be unlike his neighbors gets social good of it. Had not the
      Signore himself seen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad enough it was to have her sitting wide-eyed and absolutely indifferent
      at her machine, and so pretty that one could see the youths looking at her
      when they pretended not to; or mooning over her straw work with never a
      word of gossip or a little story about a friend, more than if they were
      all stones: but what did these absences all by herself mean, which looked
      the worse now that she was a decent man&rsquo;s wife? It was an absolute
      scandal&mdash;which is only another name for a godsend sometimes&mdash;to
      a sober community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oreste might pretend to shut his eyes,&mdash;he had always been a fool
      about her; but it could not be asked that all the village should do the
      same, especially those girls who would have made decent wives if any one
      had given <i>them</i> the chance, and those lads who would have known how
      to keep a wife in order if they had taken one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest, thinking of these things, sighed. He, too, might affect
      blindness; but he would need to be stone deaf as well to escape hearing
      what every tongue in the village felt it a duty and a privilege to confide
      to him daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be admitted that the Signorina Americana has something to
      answer for,&rdquo; the priest wound up, as he invariably did, and always
      with an indulgent accent which forgave while it accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signorina Americana!&mdash;how many times was she not levelled at the
      ears of the Signore Americano who had inherited her tradition with the
      villa of which he was the next lessee. If the contadini were to be
      believed, there was little for which she might not be held accountable.
      They spoke of her smilingly, Oreste tenderly, the priest indulgently (the
      Signorina also had possessed a generous taste in wines), and Gioja not at
      all. Yet apparently it was precisely Gioja who might have had most to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; if I could have foreseen when I brought that child to her!
      But what harm could come to her from earning a few francs as the
      Signo-rina&rsquo;s maid? I chose her for the very reason that she had more
      gentleness and was more educated than the others,&mdash;the Signorina,
      your countrywoman, was herself very educated and full of <i>gentilezza</i>.
      But she was too good to Gioja, and then she could never be made to see.
      She had a way with her,&mdash;when I began to remonstrate with her she
      would fill up my glass and ask about my poor, and, before I knew it&mdash;<i>altro!</i>
      she was very generous, your countrywoman. But if there are many like her
      in your country it must be a terrible place; a man would not possess his
      own soul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would sit here&mdash;precisely where I sit now&mdash;and smile
      a little smile she had, and twist this rose-vine about her fingers, and
      just so she twisted us all. Ah,&rdquo; he concluded, lifting his glass,
      &ldquo;she was truly terrible, that Signorina; but <i>simpatica, altro!</i>
      never have I seen so <i>simpatica</i> a signorina.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Simpatica!</i> When you are that, there is nothing else you can be; and
      when you are not that, nothing that you can be is of any use. When
      everybody, down to the newsboys and cab-openers, loves you and doesn&rsquo;t
      know why,&mdash;you are <i>simpatica</i>; when people would rather do
      things for you than not, and don&rsquo;t care about the payment,&mdash;then
      you may be sure you are <i>simpatica</i>; when the expression of their
      eyes and the tones of their voices change insensibly when they look at and
      speak to you,&mdash;there is no room to doubt that you are <i>simpatica</i>.
      You may not be rich, nor beautiful, nor &ldquo;educated&rdquo; (such a
      very different thing from book-fed), but you do not need to be. <i>Simpatica</i>
      is the comprehending sky of praise in which separate stars of admiration
      are swallowed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Signore figured rapidly the mischief possible of accomplishment
      by a dangerous Signorina possessing this attribute, the priest drank
      another glass of wine and returned to the trouble of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, indeed, with a wife&rsquo;s work to do, she would settle
      down like others; but Oreste encourages her wilfulness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not speak to Gioja herself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest, crossing himself.
      &ldquo;I have tried that once. She has a terrible nature,&mdash;that
      child! I have never told any one; but see if I have not reason to say so,
      Signore.&rdquo; He sipped his wine agitatedly, and then began with
      feeling:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the Signorina to begin with; she saw that the child was
      pretty, and she put ideas in her head. And in fact, though Heaven forbid I
      should compare Gioja, who is only a little <i>contadina</i>. with a real
      Signorina, yet she has always seemed to me to have a little something
      about her which recalls the Signorina herself,&mdash;a way of walking and
      carrying her head. And the Signorina had not an idea of keeping her in her
      place. She was always giving her gowns and ribbons and trinkets and
      vanities of all kinds,&mdash;that was her way, always giving. The end of
      it was that one day I surprised that child with a hat of the Signorina&rsquo;s
      on her unhappy head; yes, actually, Signore, if you will credit me, a hat,&mdash;a
      <i>cappello di signora</i> on her head!&rdquo; He spread his hands in
      deprecating despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore looked blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Signore, you are like your countrywoman; it is impossible to
      make you understand! But it must be a country,&mdash;yours! For a girl
      like Gioja to put a hat on is to declare herself without shame at once.
      Honest girls of her class let such <i>roba di signore</i> alone; yes, and
      rightly, for God has put people in their places. A girl who showed herself
      in a signora&rsquo;s hat would find it impossible to live in Vignola; she
      would be hooted out of the village. And as for the wife of a lad like
      Oreste pretending to that,&mdash;half-a-dozen lovers would not be a worse
      scandal. Those at least the others could understand, but a <i>cappello di
      signora</i>&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped to take several agitated sips,
      shaking his head all the time. &ldquo;I do not say she would have been so
      mad as to cross the threshold in it (the Signorina had given it to her to
      sell for the feathers upon it); but who could tell what such a girl might
      do? I scolded her well for her wicked vanity, and such ideas above her
      place. Santa Maria!&mdash;lovers and such are enough, without a scandal
      like that among my people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what was the end? Signore, she rushed off and hung that hat,
      with at least twenty francs&rsquo; worth of good feathers on it, in the
      Madonna&rsquo;s chapel, beside &lsquo;Maso&rsquo;s crutch and the little
      hearts and legs and other offerings to Our Lady! There it hung, where all
      the world would see it, and every tongue in the place be set wagging, if I
      had not providentially gone in and found it before Mass next day. And even
      then what could I do? It was the Madonna&rsquo;s, and I dared not remove
      it. But Heaven sends accidents, and as it chanced, <i>providentially</i>,
      Signore, my candle brushed the feathers in passing and, <i>presto</i>, I
      dropped it quickly into a bucket of water. It was not fit for Our Lady
      after that, so I took it away, and I myself made it up to her in candles,
      that no one might feel hurt. And after all nobody was the richer for all
      those francs&rsquo; worth of feathers; they were singed more than I hoped,
      and did not bring me in Florence the price of the candles. Oh, she has a
      terrible nature,&mdash;that Gioja! No, no, <i>grazie</i>,&mdash;if I must
      speak to Oreste, I must; but to her!&mdash;candles cost, Signore, and I am
      a poor man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still shaking his head, he rose to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore, left alone, paced the terrace a few times, smiling to
      himself; then he sat down again,&mdash;this time in the priest&rsquo;s
      place,&mdash;and fell to musing, and as he mused his fingers stole almost
      furtively to the long rose-tendrils, and twisted them gently, while the
      smile died abruptly on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he rang, and Giuseppina came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may take away these things,&rdquo; said the Signore, &ldquo;and
      bring me pen and paper. Oh, and by the way, Giuseppina, in future put my
      seat here,&mdash;the valley sees itself better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming from the post that evening the Signore was aware of a slender shape
      slipping along through the deepening shadows ahead. Quickening his steps,
      he overtook it easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Buon sera</i>; so it is you, Gioja?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Si, Signore!&rdquo;&mdash;the voice was both startled and
      appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Signore strode along looking keenly at the downcast face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oreste is not with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Signore; he went to the city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have doubtless been visiting your nonna?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Signore,&rdquo;&mdash;the voice was almost inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore turned on his heel, with a curt &ldquo;<i>Buona sera!</i>&rdquo;
      and was still muttering things under his breath when, fifteen minutes
      later, he beheld from the terrace Oreste and Elisabetta toiling wearily up
      the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well she times it,&rdquo; he thought contemptuously, as the
      bell of the big gate sounded, and he heard Giuseppina&rsquo;s challenge:
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Amici</i>, friends,&rdquo; answered Oreste&rsquo;s voice, and
      Oreste swiftly followed, with his frank smile and a square envelope of
      dull blue, which the Signore&rsquo;s hand involuntarily stretched to
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ecco</i>, Signore,&mdash;the only one!&rdquo; said Oreste, with
      that polite gesture of regret with which he daily accompanied this small
      comedy. The Signore having possessed himself of the letter avidly, put it
      into his pocket with ostentatious carelessness and coolly lighted a
      cigarette. Oreste smiled comprehendingly but respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a long day of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Signore,&rdquo; Oreste smiled with the satisfied air of one
      who has done a good day&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have made a handful of money,&rdquo; continued the
      Signore, severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oreste shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Not great things,&mdash;but, <i>altro</i>,
      I am content.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore shrugged in his turn. &ldquo;Each to his own mind. Your <i>sposina</i>
      has also made a long day; I saw her just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; it is a long way to Vincigliata, when one must walk. The
      Signore&rsquo;s commands?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, the Signorina Americana, if this was her work, had small reason to
      be proud of it. The Signore&rsquo;s frown enveloped even the blue
      envelope, at which he stood staring long after Oreste had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it ran through the spring months,&mdash;the mournfully beautiful
      Tuscan spring. The nightingales in the villa gardens sang and sang, at
      dusk, in the moonlight, and at dawn, and the fireflies glittered all
      through the darkness up and down the olive slopes. An intenser life
      quickened in the little community as the summer stirred in the veins of
      her children. The youths went singing up and down the hills, and the girls
      and women lingered over their water jars at the fountain in the square.
      For what is it to be poor in the summer time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the Signore, lying awake at night, heard Oreste&rsquo;s mellow
      voice as he passed by to the little house. But through all this gayety of
      being Gioja stole silently and dreamily, and the whisper of turned heads
      and eyes askance followed her. For there were the ever-recurring <i>festas</i>,
      when Oreste went to the city, and where then did Oreste&rsquo;s <i>sposa</i>
      go? That is what the community would like to know; for the tale of her
      grandmother was quite too large for the village throat. She kept her
      secret well,&mdash;yes; but there is only one kind of a secret possible to
      the Italian mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Birbone!&rdquo; said the women, with contempt of Oreste, while the
      men laughed and shrugged their shoulders. Oreste had caught a pretty <i>sposa</i>
      who had thought herself much too good for them, but, <i>ma chè</i>,&mdash;he
      was paying for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible that the public curiosity should content itself with
      being curious. Maria, one of those public-minded souls which never lack in
      any community, toiled all the way over to Vincigliata, and brought back
      personal assurance from the <i>nonna</i> herself that that pious
      granddaughter had not been seen in Vincigliata all these months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight good miles I trudged in all that sun, and a day&rsquo;s work
      lost,&rdquo; declared Maria, mopping her brow in the midst of an excited
      and sympathetic group. &ldquo;<i>If</i> my legs ache! But for the good of
      the community I did it; and what I know to-night the priest shall know
      before morning. I made haste to go to-day, for to-morrow, being the <i>festa</i>
      of our Saint John, Oreste goes to the city, and that <i>civetta</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And nobody could say but that Maria had done well, and the girl deserved
      whatever might come of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the priest, sad-eyed and stern, knocked at the door of the little
      house in the early morning after Mass, no one was there. Having delivered
      a vain fusillade, to the accompaniment of many suggestions offered from
      the neighbors&rsquo; windows, the priest turned away and betook himself,
      with a clouded brow, to the Signore, who had invited him, by Oreste, to
      breakfast with him that morning. He was waiting for him now on the terrace
      with a morning countenance; and the breakfast-table, heaped with roses,
      wore a festal air which did not escape the priest, preoccupied though he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You also are keeping a feast, Signore, to appearances?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed! a <i>festa</i> Americana?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my own. And now what is it about these two? Oreste, I know,
      went to the city. I tried to engage him, but he was pre-engaged to that
      patron of his. And Gioja,&mdash;well, I saw her pass a little later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we were in the church,&mdash;the guilty child!&rdquo; said
      the priest, sternly. &ldquo;But where can she have gone?&rdquo; he added,
      sighing. &ldquo;I have been much to blame; I have been too negligent; I
      should have dealt with her from the first. <i>Culpa mia!</i>&rdquo; He
      crossed himself and looked so discouraged that the Signore was touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, <i>amico mio</i>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As you say, it is
      a bad business; and, arrange it how you will, it will never be well that
      those two shall live here. The last of it will never be heard,&mdash;if I
      know your people. I am going away to Livorno next week, and I have asked
      Oreste to go with me. I like the fellow, and away from here she may come
      to her senses. She is young, and, guilty though she may be, she does not
      seem case-hardened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going away!&rdquo; exclaimed the startled priest, in dismay.
      &ldquo;And going to take those two away from their own country,&mdash;to a
      foreign place! What an idea,&mdash;but what an idea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely foreign; it is only the other side of Florence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah! to you, but to us villagers! It is not a little thing to
      leave one&rsquo;s home, where one has been born and bred, and knows his
      neighbors, after all, whether they be good or bad. It is a great thing to
      know one&rsquo;s neighbors. And to go so far!&mdash;but they will think
      twice before they say &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Oreste goes willingly. I do not think he is so
      blind; he knows well they are not friendly to his <i>sposa</i> here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gioja,&rdquo; said the startled priest, &ldquo;will she go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest drew a long breath, half relief, half regret, and wholly
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, it is perhaps the best that could happen. But to lose
      two of my flock&mdash;and to leave one&rsquo;s country like that! You are
      a strange people, you Americans. And what becomes of us without either you
      or the Signorina Americana here in the villa?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are more Americans,&rdquo; replied the Signore, smiling;
      &ldquo;and who knows but that your Signorina will return to make you more
      trouble yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest shook his head. &ldquo;The next time she may bring her own
      maid. Not another girl from our village shall she turn the head of, that
      Signorina,&rdquo; and the very tone of his voice as he said it was witness
      that he affirmed what he knew to be false. The Signore understood and
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it all away, <i>amico mio</i>, for to-day, and go with me to
      Florence. Gioja has gone; and you can do nothing but listen to your
      people, who will deafen you before night. Come and see your <i>bella
      Firenze</i> in her <i>festa</i> dress. We will take a tram below and find
      a cab at the gates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest&rsquo;s face brightened like a child&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Signore, now it is I you are proposing to carry away! But why
      not? It is long since I was in Florence, and I have already said service
      here. But it is not necessary to say anything to my people. Discretion,
      Signore, discretion is a great thing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it happened that when the village folk saw the good father depart
      in company with the Signore <i>forestiere</i>, they sagely concluded, with
      that sense of the importance of our own affairs common to the race, that
      the two had gone to Fiesole, or who knew but even Florence, to consult the
      authorities in the matter of that unhappy Gioja. And, in point of fact,
      though the priest was fairly running away from the subject, he was
      destined to run straight into its arms instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence was all in <i>festa</i>; and if there is anything lovelier than
      Florence in <i>festa</i>, who has seen it? The streets ran over with
      bright sunshine; and the Florentines, reinforced by <i>contadini</i> from
      all the neighboring towns, in holiday garb, made a bright, shifting mass
      for the sunbeams to play over. Arno rolled its now shallow stream like
      muddy gold, and pale golden palaces stood loftily up and looked down at
      her. Over her streaming Ways, Florence shook the bells in all her towers
      every fifteen minutes, and at intervals the deep, golden-throated voice in
      Giotto&rsquo;s Tower answered with a rich hum, hum-m, hum-m-m, like a
      melodious summer bee. The strident notes of the <i>grilli</i>, in their
      little wicker cages, brought from the Cascine at dawn, completed the
      joyous pandemonium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore&rsquo;s spirits ran at higher tide than even the bright tide
      of humanity about him. He laughed at all; he bought flowers of the boys
      and girls who ran after the carriage holding up glowing armfuls, until the
      carriage-seat was heaped, and the priest held up his hands at the
      extravagance. He climaxed his folly by buying all the remaining <i>grilli</i>
      in their cages, and letting them loose upon the grass of the Cascine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not scold, <i>amico mio</i>,&rdquo; he said to the priest gayly;
      &ldquo;I told you it is a <i>festa</i>. I have come into a fortune, and it
      is written that nobody must be shut up to-day or hungry.&rdquo; He tossed
      a handful of soldi to a group of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid your fortune will not last long,&rdquo; replied the
      priest, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he forgot his own prudence when, a little later, they went to a
      restaurant,&mdash;not Doney&rsquo;s, where the foolish tourists go,
      fancying themselves in Italy, and where the priest would have been
      miserable,&mdash;but Gilli&rsquo;s on the Piazza Signoria. There, it being
      a feast day, and his host newly come into a fortune, the good father ate,
      for the honor of religion and his own temporal good, such a meal as had
      never before found its way to his stomach, and washed it down with glasses
      of Chianti, not merely old (vecchio), but extravagantly old (stravecchio).
      Golden moments were these, and he put down his glass at last with a sigh
      of regret that it was impossible to prolong them further. His limit of
      possibility was reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Signore, casting an extravagant fee upon the
      table, &ldquo;where next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Baptistery and the Duomo, my son,&rdquo; answered the
      priest, with sudden gravity, crossing himself, &ldquo;to say our <i>grazie</i>,
      and put up a little prayer to our good Saint John.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was precisely upon emerging from the door of Gilli&rsquo;s in this
      comfortable and untroubled frame of mind, arising from the perfect balance
      of the carnal and the spiritual, that he came face to face with the worst
      trouble of all. For, straightening his shabby hat and smoothing his shabby
      cassock, what should his eyes fall upon but Oreste,&mdash;Oreste, who,
      having that moment emerged from a café below, was assisting a very elegant
      signora into his cab. Just as he got her safely tucked in, his eye caught
      the two pairs staring at him. His sturdy face blanched; then, before
      either could make step forward, he had shut the door, sprung quickly to
      the seat, and, touching up Elisabetta, with a glance of defiance whirled
      away. The two left, staring, drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ebbene</i>,&rdquo; remarked the Signore, at last, &ldquo;so the
      patron was a <i>padrona</i>; perhaps Gioja has not been so much to blame
      after all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will know,&rdquo; answered the priest, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signore said a word to the nearest cabman, slipping something into his
      hand, and in a moment they were bowling up the Via Calzaioli. It cost a
      city cabman nothing to keep Elisabetta in sight; and they drew up in the
      Piazza del Duomo just in time to see Oreste deferentially assisting his
      Signora to alight at the Cathedral steps. He saw them and his eyes shot
      such a glance of stern warning that both men sat stupidly, and the next
      moment nearly fell over each other as the Signora, in her silks and
      nodding plumes, swept by,&mdash;for, lo, it was Gioja!
    </p>
    <p>
      In another instant she had swept up the steps and the great doors had
      swallowed her. Then Oreste&rsquo;s manner changed. He leaned against the
      cab-door, and turned upon the two men a regard which said: &ldquo;And now
      what have you to say about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a decidedly awkward silence while they drew near; then the
      Signore burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found a fine patron, <i>amico mio!</i>&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What folly!&rdquo; ejaculated the priest, holding up his hands and
      recovering breath at last. &ldquo;Gran&rsquo; Dioy what folly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverendo,&rdquo; replied Oreste, quietly, &ldquo;perhaps not so
      much folly as some of you have thought. Perhaps I know what the tongues up
      there wag like, and if I choose not to mind, whose affair is that? If it
      pleases us to please ourselves, who is the worse for that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the scandal!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest. &ldquo;And the waste,
      and the ideas you are putting in Gioja&rsquo;s head,&mdash;the wicked
      vanity and pride&mdash;Oh, I told the Signorina how it would end!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that, Reverendo, you will pardon me; but tongues must wag
      when they are hung in the middle, and if they wag about Gioja,&mdash;why
      it does n&rsquo;t hurt her, and some one else goes safe. And as for the
      waste,&mdash;the price of a fare now and then,&mdash;why if it suits us to
      live on polenta six days, and take our pleasure on the seventh, whose
      misery is that? I have never yet lacked my soldo for the Church or for a
      neighbor poorer than I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the ideas you are encouraging in her unhappy head!&mdash;but I
      will have something to say to that child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverendo,&rdquo; interposed Oreste, sternly, &ldquo;by your leave,&mdash;you
      are a good man, half a saint, and I am only an ignorant peasant, but there
      are some things priests and nuns do not understand, and what one does not
      understand, that one should not meddle with. The Signorina understood; she
      knew well it was neither pride nor vanity in Gioja, but just a kind of <i>poesia</i>
      which made her like to play the signora. The Signorina understood because
      she herself was full of <i>poesia</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Signorina,&mdash;the Signorina!&rdquo; interjected the
      priest, in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>knew</i>,&rdquo; Oreste went on. &ldquo;You remember the
      time of the hat, Reverendo?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>If</i> I remember!&rdquo; groaned the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ebbene!</i>&rdquo; said Oreste, emphatically, &ldquo;when I
      found it out, I went straight to the Signorina and told her. She was on
      the terrace, and she sat down and laughed a little. You remember our
      Signorina&rsquo;s way of laughing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to the priest that he addressed this; but it was the Signore,
      looking straight before him and smiling, who looked as if he remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing would do,&rdquo; continued Oreste, &ldquo;but that she must
      jump into my cab then and there, with only a lace on her head, and she a
      Signorina! [here the Signore laughed aloud]&mdash;and drive straight to
      Florence, not to one of the small shops, but to the great milliner&rsquo;s
      on Tornabuoni, where she bought a hat,&mdash;who knows what it cost?&mdash;and
      she bade me take it to Gioja and tell her to wear it when she liked, for
      there was nothing wicked about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest groaned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; added Oreste, with the suspicion of a twinkle, &ldquo;she
      bade us say nothing about it, lest you, Reverendo, might think it your
      duty to lecture the child again; and it was a pity, she said, to make so
      good a man uncomfortable. So, as she could not wear it openly, we had to
      find a way under the plate; and as the whole village would have been
      talking if we went away together, I had to make that little story of a
      patron. Once outside of Vignola, I wait for Gioja, and there in the olive
      grove she makes herself into a signora; and on the way home we stop again,
      and&mdash;the signora&rsquo;s hat and gown stowed away under my seat&mdash;my
      little <i>sposa</i> climbs up beside me and we talk it all over. And then
      the next day I count my francs, and the folk call me &lsquo;<i>Birbone</i>;&rsquo;
      and the lads think evil of my Gioja because she would never look at them;
      and we laugh in our sleeves. What does all that matter when one is happy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said the priest, sternly, &ldquo;you let all Vignola
      think your wife has a lover, and say nothing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have to think something; and isn&rsquo;t it better they should
      think she has a lover, Reverendo, than a <i>cappello di signora?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; assented the priest, quickly; &ldquo;a lover, at
      least, they can all understand; and only too many of them&mdash;Madonna
      pardon them!&mdash;have had; but a signora&rsquo;s hat nobody in the
      village has ever had, and they would never pardon Gioja for having. And
      they have right; Gioja has no business with a signora&rsquo;s hat, nor you
      to waste your time and money, as if you would be <i>bambini</i> all your
      lives. And for you, a man, to make yourself the servant of your wife,&mdash;oh,
      it is shameful, <i>vergognoso!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon again, Reverendo, but that, too, you can&rsquo;t understand.
      If it is Gioja&rsquo;s <i>poesia</i> to play the signora,&mdash;why, Gioja
      is <i>my poesia</i>. As for its lasting, <i>altro!</i> the future is long;
      and if we had others to feed all that might be different. She is only a
      child herself now; but when the good God sends a child to a child, that
      makes a woman of her; He himself sees to that. When that comes, she will
      care nothing to play the signora with her stupid Oreste. All this our
      Signorina knew; for that night, when the child came to me weeping, and
      saying how wicked she had been, and begging me to forgive her and marry
      her at once, <i>at once</i>&mdash;I, Signori, who would have married her
      any moment for years!&mdash;it put me in trouble. I had fear to take her
      like that, and perhaps have her sorry for it later. But I went to our
      Signorina with her, and told her all; and she looked at us both and said:
      &lsquo;Marry her, Oreste; you safely may;&rsquo; for the Signorina
      understood. And so&mdash;I married her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the two young men met suddenly, and exchanged across the gulf
      of position and race one rapid thrill of comprehension. The priest looked
      half-timidly at both; but perhaps he, too, comprehended something, for he
      said meekly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, I did no harm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied Oreste, with his frank smile; &ldquo;but
      that was not your fault, Reverendo. And now, if the Signore and you will
      excuse me, that was the bell of the Elevation. If Gioja saw you, she would
      have no more pleasure; and that would be all the more a pity, because it
      is our last <i>festa</i> here. We are going to live with the Signore and
      his Signora. Is n&rsquo;t it so, Signore?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest, with vivacity, &ldquo;so that
      was your <i>festa</i> and your fortune, Signore? And that is why you have
      so much sympathy for even the <i>grills</i> and these foolish children!
      Well, well, it is perhaps the best that could happen; for it would be
      impossible to go on giving scandal like this, and if I said a word you
      would all be for taking my life. It may do for Gioja, who is not like the
      others; but Heaven forbid the other <i>ragazze</i> should get such ideas
      in their heads; I have enough to do to keep track of them and their
      affairs as it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signori!&rdquo; said Oreste, warningly. The two slunk behind the
      next cab, and from there beheld the stream of life suddenly burst from the
      big doors of the Duomo,&mdash;men and women and children, prince and
      citizen and peasant, and among them a slender, graceful shape, her
      cappello di signora sitting well upon the ruffled gold of her hair, and
      her long skirt raised in one gloved hand with a gesture at which the
      Signore&rsquo;s heart beat suddenly faster against the blue envelope above
      it. So very excellent an imitation of the Signora that even an expert need
      not blush to be deceived by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oreste stepped forward and flung open the cab-door with ostentation. The
      Signora mounted languidly, and sank back against the cushions, making a
      great rustling of silk. The loungers on the Duomo steps stole covert
      glances at the pretty woman. Then Oreste slammed the door, took off his
      hat, and approached deferentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commanda, Signora?&rdquo; he said, loud enough for everybody to
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Alla casa</i>,&mdash;home,&rdquo; responded the Signora, with
      superb languor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, mounting upon the seat, with a parting glance of mingled triumph and
      humor in the direction of the two watchers, Oreste, Elisabetta, and the
      Signora whirled triumphantly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two left upon the sidewalk remained speechless for a few minutes; then
      the priest&rsquo;s eye caught his companion&rsquo;s, deprecatingly, but
      with an echo of Oreste&rsquo;s twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Signorina,&rdquo; he said, with an indulgent sigh, &ldquo;she
      has much to answer for!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Signore, looking into the distance and laughing softly to himself,
      said not a word.

    <h2>
      I&mdash;FROM ROGER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OU are my friend.
      Therefore I am sure of your patience. My dearest, yield it to me now, of
      all times! This is a confession and prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, I might dissemble still. Chance lends the ready garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am resolved I will have no more lies. I will speak the truth, though
      I lose you. I never knew much good to come of lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear, if you love me much, this will pain you bitterly. I should be glad
      to die now, if so I rightly might, that you might think of me always as
      you do now, and <i>she</i> might never know, or be wounded in her faith
      and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me has been destined the doing of that wrong I look upon as the
      deadliest of all. Treachery is the crime, and the crime is mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me tell you again, you tender woman, you dearest and noblest in the
      world, how I love you. I think of you constantly, I yearn for your sweet
      companionship. You are my dear ideal,&mdash;you are to me all peacefulness
      and worth and wisdom and womanly greatness and incomparable grace. You are
      the pure air to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear, it is because my love for you is the best that is in me that I am at
      such pains to make my confession absolute. My heart grows imperious at
      thought of you, and leaps for the highest course, though that bids for the
      supernal sacrifice of losing you&mdash;you, so sweetly gained! For you I
      should be happy to die now, heart in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be sweet, I think, to die now, to leave this black dilemma, to
      vanish utterly. And yet, while you live, all splendor and all graces are
      here!
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Dear Anne, there is another woman I have been making love to&mdash;how
      I loathe to write the name&mdash;Doris Ewing, who loves me as I love you,
      and to whom I grew tender just in hopelessness of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far away in the North you were, so like the figment of a fond
      impossible ideal, and she was here beside me, dark-eyed and sweet. I loved
      her. So often I said it&mdash;so sweetly she believed, and the habit grew.
      &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I said, even when I knew that love was just
      like. For often she was but as a small craft on the heaving sea of my
      passion, the sea that ran to its flood-tide for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her repeatedly I loved her&mdash;and lied. Was it any the less a
      lie that the spirit of romance was strong within me, and my heart-hunger
      made me mad? I loved her in this fashion, say, because she was loving, and
      my heart was full of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not come to me forcibly at the time that I was lying. I had come
      into the habit of her, and the words did not stick in my throat, as lies
      usually do. I did not despise myself. My duplicity I learned to
      contemplate with equanimity and to forget, and so I lied ardently and
      successfully. What a bad success it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      For Doris loved me dearly, and cried over me a bit, now and then, I
      suspect, and was beautiful and happy. I wondered, sometimes (forgetting
      the reason that lay in my larger desire&mdash;you!), why I did not really
      love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is my story, as well as I understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is very sweet, and I am very fond of her. I seek to extenuate nothing;
      I write the crude facts as I know them. She has black hair and eyes; she
      is very white and slender, with nestling ways. She is not very learned or
      rich, but patrician and proud; all agree that she is beautiful. She is
      debonair and sweet, and when I think of you she is nothing to me&mdash;nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      But I tried to love her just in love&rsquo;s despite; and she was happy in
      the main, and I was half-resigned. I stifle when I think of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      How pitiful it all was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Often she leaned, touched my shoulder, and spoke with downcast eyes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really love me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very tenderly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passionately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passionately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all your heart?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forever?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She mistrusted me no more than the day mistrusts the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one night I sat late in my room, thinking. It was cold; the wild wind
      arose, hissing in the stark trees. Out in the cold sky the stars shone
      white and multitudinous. There came to me a wanton mood; I floated with
      it, pensive and relaxed. I had no wish to change it, but desired only to
      sit peacefully through the midnight until sleep should come, to lightly
      conjecture and mildly reflect, to clasp my knees by the fire and await the
      fortunes of the hour. Life had grown trivial.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by degrees the thoughts of you came intensely and possessed me. That
      was the night I wrote you that mad long letter of adoration and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, you were to me impossible! I had been half-resigned. But that night
      passion reigned. It was my dearest tribute just to tell you of the love I
      had for you. If it was madness, it was a sweet madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought when your letter would come I would sit for a while with it in
      my hand, and dream the sweet, the terrible, the improbable,&mdash;before I
      opened it to read your kind wording (I knew it would be kind) of what my
      despair taught me to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wires shot stupefying joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Everything! Why did you wait so long? Come to me now&mdash;at
      once! I give you all!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the message there at the street. I gazed blankly. Then with
      realization came tumultuous sweetness that was pain. Doris, across the
      way, stopped singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news, Roger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best, and the worst!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Tell me about it, when I come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ...Do your eyebrows slope, and your lips upcurl?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have written it all out. When she comes (she is coming soon) I shall
      tell her all, as I have told you. This is to be the blackest hour of my
      life. I have made up my mind to tell her the truth. It is her right. But
      my heart has so often failed me. If this is tenderness, why what a false
      tenderness it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no more hopes of you now than I had when I wrote you. But I belong
      to you, and will always belong to you, just for your once loving, even
      though you despise me, now and forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall tell her frankly, extenuating nothing. <i>For I will have no more
      lies</i>. On that I am resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne, I do not truly live without you, and I crave the intensest living. I
      think of you always as I saw you first&mdash;tall and fair, with the gold
      across your temples, and the museful, wistful mouth with its serious
      thinking silences and then its soft rapid speech, and the eyes, the blue
      eyes, that had for me such exquisite language. You are repose&mdash;Heaven!
      And I am in a hell of my own making, and, dearest, I could not help it!
      Ah, I am pleading! I did not mean to plead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you have a dream of me, as noble, say? Here am I, who love life
      because of you, who love you more than that life or my hope of heaven. But
      what to you is such a love?
    </p>
    <p>
      She is coming soon, and I shall tell her. I say I shall have no more
      deception. I am yours&mdash;yours! I dare not write the prayer that is in
      my heart. I cannot say farewell. Remember, when you despise me worst, I am
      yours!

      III&mdash;THE TWO WOMEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>aid Doris: &ldquo;You
      are just as I pictured you. May I call you just Anne? How long they
      prayed! I did not know you would come. I could not think who you were,
      standing beside his grave so beautiful and tearless. I could not see well
      for weeping, and the wind was cold, and my head ached. Oh, the wan face!
      The black clothes&mdash;I did not like the black. I wanted to lie down
      there with him and be covered up. The clay was so cold and wet. Oh, how
      cold my heart grew! Did you think they prayed long? I was so cold!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been told how he died,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entered the library, where he was waiting for me,&rdquo; Doris
      replied. &ldquo;It was near twilight. He sat by the window, looking out.
      When I came in he turned and his face was pale. The room was cold. The
      fire had gone out. I never saw him pale before; I was frightened and cried
      out. He came to re-assure me, and his face was so pale! He looked at me
      long and anxiously&mdash;so anxiously. I did not understand this look, it
      was so strange. It hurt me because I did not understand it. Now I know it
      was physical suffering. He went back to the window and sank into his
      chair. &lsquo;Are you not ill?&rsquo; I asked. He answered, &lsquo;A
      little,&rsquo; and added, &lsquo;It will pass.&rsquo; But he did not speak
      at all or touch me, and when I stroked his forehead he leaned suddenly
      forward, his face in his arms, on the window-sill, and would not answer
      me. I ran out to tell them he was ill. When the doctor came I was told he
      was dead. They gave me his letter to send you, and tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not wish,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;to read the letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Doris did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would make you less able to realize that he is&mdash;gone,&rdquo;
      said Anne, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;and then it was to you,&mdash;not
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other&rsquo;s face was suffused with tender pity. She spoke
      impulsively, and yet with a timorous boldness, as one who ventures upon
      hazardous and novel ways:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doris, he loved you with all his heart!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke of you so often, Anne. We shall always be friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure he loved me so?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s mouth tremored
      at the corners. &ldquo;He did not tell me often enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loved you dearly,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if you knew what sweet comfort you give! You are sure?&mdash;quite
      sure?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE DEAD OAK
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Anna Vernon Dorsey
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE November day
      was drawing to a close. The shadows were deepening in the pine forest that
      lay on one side of the sandy road. On the other side, the corn-stalks
      stood in level rows against the yellow of the sunset. My horse limped
      painfully, for he had cast a shoe several hours since, and my hurried ride
      through a thinly inhabited part of lower Maryland, with which I was
      unfamiliar, had so far brought me near no blacksmith&rsquo;s shop. Great,
      then, was my relief, on passing the wood, to find a three-cross-roads, and
      a small house with a shed from which rang the measured stroke of the
      anvil, while the square of the door was ruddy with the forge fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      After calling loudly and waiting in vain for a reply, I dismounted. Just
      then the blacksmith came to the door,&mdash;a big, low-browed, long-haired
      fellow, of few words. After examining my horse&rsquo;s feet, he announced
      that it would be necessary to replace not only the missing shoe, but also
      three others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he proceeded slowly to work, I saw that there was before me the
      prospect of a long wait which did not promise to be agreeable, for the man
      was either surly or stupid, and gave out monosyllabic replies in answer to
      my questions about the country. A dreary country it was, that through
      which I was passing,&mdash;flat, sandy, impoverished, the virtue having
      been tilled out of the soil for two hundred years. Now that the old landed
      proprietors had departed to the cities, the majority of the inhabitants
      were miserable poor whites and negroes, principally fishermen and
      oystermen. Here and there one came across a relic of the past,&mdash;an
      old manor-house, ruined or deserted, the property generally of one man, a
      former overseer, who seemed to own most of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet there was a charm of the past over this low-lying land,&mdash;a
      blaze of glory in the west, reflected in the broad river that almost
      lapped the roots of the huge pine forests that grew along its banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stood at the door of the smithy, looking eastward, I could see only
      one exception to this sombre monotony of pines. On the roadside, in the
      middle of a dense sweep of meadows, entirely isolated, stood a huge
      oak-tree, the only one of its kind to be seen for miles around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be a pretty old tree,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dead Oak? Many a hundred years old, I reckon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look dead to me,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;it has
      a dense foliage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call it,&mdash;the Dead Oak. A man hung
      himself to it three years ago,&rdquo; said the smith, with some show of
      animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the neighborhood?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a stranger round here. Nobody ever could find out where he come
      from,&mdash;Washington likely. The niggers say it&rsquo;s ha&rsquo;nted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; I asked, much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know; just ha&rsquo;nted,&rdquo; said the man gruffly,
      relapsing into silence amid a fire of sparks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving my taciturn companion, I sauntered down to the road, my steps
      turning intuitively in the direction of the old tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chill wind came from the river, and a flight of crows with harsh cries
      arose from its branches, as it stood, the central landmark in the stretch
      of meadows. On one side of the road was a zigzag rail fence, and on the
      topmost rail of this, under the tree, I seated myself. The lowest branches
      almost touched my head, and the dry and dense foliage rustled with every
      breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just beyond were two wooden posts, the entrance of a carriage-way leading
      through a corn-field to what I had not noticed before, a large house far
      back from the road. As I sat there, facing the afterglow of the sunset, I
      became aware of the figure of an old negro coming slowly through the
      corn-rows, through the gate,&mdash;a bent negro with bushy white hair.
      Taking off his rabbit-skin cap, with a courtly bow he seated himself on
      the roots of the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments we sat there in silence, the old man, with his hands
      folded, gazing into the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, uncle,&rdquo; I ventured to remark. &ldquo;Do you
      live near here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not far away,&mdash;up dat a-way,&rdquo; waving his hand
      indefinitely in the direction of the shadowy mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you lived here long?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many an&rsquo; many a year,&rdquo; he responded wearily. &ldquo;Ebber
      sence I cum inter de world. I belonged to Mars&rsquo; Brooke up yonder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must know about the man who hung himself here three years
      ago?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He war n&rsquo;t no man,&rdquo; said the old darky sternly. &ldquo;He
      wuz first quality, my young gen&rsquo;leman. I ought ter know, kase I
      buried him bofe times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, suddenly a thrill ran over me, a sense of mystery,
      something accursed brooding over this desolate spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Befo&rsquo; de Lord, boss, I don&rsquo; know, an&rsquo; nobody else
      does. It came about dis &lsquo;er&rsquo; way: De first time wuz years an&rsquo;
      years ago. Dar wuz good times in de country den. De quality had n&rsquo;t
      all gone away an&rsquo; sol&rsquo; de ole places to oberseers an&rsquo; po&rsquo;
      white trash. Mars&rsquo; Harry Brooke wuz keepin&rsquo; bachelor&rsquo;s
      hall up dar, an&rsquo; many&rsquo;s de high ol&rsquo; times and junketings
      dey had. Well, one night dey had a gran&rsquo; time, a-drinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
      a-carryin&rsquo; on, he an&rsquo; de udder young gemlemens.&lsquo;Bout day
      de party bruk up, kase de wuz sober enuff den ter ride home. I wuz a young
      chap den, an&rsquo; I wuz runnin&rsquo; on in front ter open de gate, bar&rsquo;footed,
      from de door, kase it war hot weather den, like Injum summer. When I open&rsquo;
      de gate I scrich out &lsquo;O Gord!&rsquo; an&rsquo; I like ter fall ter
      de groun&rsquo;, kase dar, wid his face all white an&rsquo; orful &lsquo;gainst
      de red leabes, a-lookin&rsquo; me right in de eyes, wuz a man tied to der
      branch, wid a white han&rsquo;chif aroun&rsquo; his neck. It didn&rsquo;t
      take me long ter jump fo&rsquo;ward an&rsquo; take him down, an&rsquo;
      when de gemlemen rid up dar he wuz a-lyin&rsquo; on de groun&rsquo; an&rsquo;
      me a-settin&rsquo; right hyar on dis same stump wid his curly head on my
      knees. He war n&rsquo;t quite dead an&rsquo; his han&rsquo; kotch mine, an&rsquo;
      his beautiful brown eyes closed a minute, an&rsquo; he gasped like an&rsquo;
      died. All de gemlemen dat came up an&rsquo; stan&rsquo; &lsquo;roun&rsquo;,
      dey say dey nebber see any one so handsom&rsquo; ez my young man wuz, jes
      like one er de marble statues in de parlor, wid a eagle nose, an&rsquo; a
      mouth many a young lady must &lsquo;a&rsquo; kissed. But dose days wuz
      ober fur him far ebber,&mdash;yes, mon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De quarest thing wuz, he didn&rsquo;t hab nuthin&rsquo; on but a
      shirt, an&rsquo; dat wuz de fines&rsquo; quality, real linin, embroidered,
      but no mark or sign on it ter tell whar he cum from. Nobody ain&rsquo;t
      nebber seed him befo&rsquo; in dis part ob de kentry. Mars&rsquo; Harry
      sont all ober the kentry, clar up ter Washin&rsquo;ton an&rsquo; Baltimor&rsquo;,
      but nobody cum fo&rsquo;ward ter claim him, so he wuz buried. De parson
      say he can&rsquo;t be buried in de cons&rsquo;crated groun&rsquo;, kus he
      mus&rsquo; &lsquo;a&rsquo; kill hisself, so me an&rsquo; anudder man
      buried him in de medder, under dis tree, right nigh whar you is a-settin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s narrative ran on monotonously. It seemed as natural,
      as much a part of the scene, as the croaking of the frogs in the deepening
      twilight, in which it seemed that I could almost see that white face with
      its aquiline nose and large brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat wuz long ago, long ago,&rdquo; the old man resumed, &ldquo;long
      ago. De War come an&rsquo; went, an&rsquo; Mars&rsquo; Harry wuz killed,
      an&rsquo; de firs&rsquo; people lef&rsquo; de kentry and de kentry wuz
      like new-made sod, dirt up&rsquo;ards; but I nebber fo&rsquo;got my young
      gemleman, real quality, hangin&rsquo; hyar in dis tree, away from all his
      people. Well, boss, many years parse, an&rsquo; Mars&rsquo; Harry&rsquo;s
      oberseer done bought de ole place up dar. One night &lsquo;bout three
      years ago dey gib one er dese hyar big abricultural suppers, an&rsquo; dey
      set dare all night eatin&rsquo; an&rsquo; drinkin&rsquo; like dere betters
      used ter do. It wuz de same time er year, but misty an&rsquo; damp an&rsquo;
      in de early mornin&rsquo; I wuz comin&rsquo; long de road an&rsquo; I see
      a crowd gaddered aroun&rsquo; de tree, jus&rsquo; like it wuz dat udder
      mornin&rsquo; long time ago. When I come up, boss, for Gord! dar wuz my
      young, beautiful gemleman a-lyin&rsquo; on de groun&rsquo;, stiff an&rsquo;
      stark, in his shirt, wid dat hankerchief &lsquo;roun&rsquo; his neck. I
      wuz glad ter see him ag&rsquo;in, but he war n&rsquo;t nearly alive, like
      he wuz befo&rsquo;. De doctor wuz dere, an&rsquo; he felt him an&rsquo; he
      say, &lsquo;Dis man bin dead fo&rsquo; days. Who has hang dis corpse to
      dis tree? Who is de man?&rsquo; Jes&rsquo; like dey say befo&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;Who is de man?&rsquo; Nobody remember&rsquo; him &lsquo;cept&rsquo;n&rsquo;
      me. De ole crowd dat wuz dere befor&rsquo;, de quality, dey all parsed
      &lsquo;way, what wid de War an&rsquo; one thing ur nudder, all gone but
      me. But I nebber said nuthin&rsquo; ter be called ole crazy nigger,&mdash;no,
      mon. Dare he wuz, shore &lsquo;nuff, de same eagle nose an&rsquo; brown
      eyes an&rsquo; curls, de same leetle scratch, like de razor done scratch
      him on de chin. I knowed him, an&rsquo; I cyarried him; none er dem common
      folks ain&rsquo;t fetched him. Dey abertised eberywhar, but nobody ain&rsquo;t
      answer.&lsquo;&rsquo;Case dey can&rsquo;t. Dey war n&rsquo;t nobody lef&rsquo;
      ter answer &lsquo;cept me,&rdquo; and the old man gave an eerie chuckle.
      &ldquo;De doctors an&rsquo; de lawyers talk it all ober, but dey cay n&rsquo;t
      agree, an&rsquo; de parson, one er dese hyar new kind, he say he kin be
      buried in de churchyard, but de people make a fuss, kase he mought er bin
      a su&rsquo;cide. So I helped bury him ag&rsquo;in. Seems like I wuz
      specially &lsquo;pinted ter be his body-sarvant; dis time it&rsquo;s right
      outside de churchyard, an&rsquo; nobody don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s him
      but me, kase dey all passed away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A pale, watery moon had emerged, the wind soughed among the pine-trees,
      and away off an owl hooted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De nex&rsquo; time I&rsquo;s gwine to bury him right in de
      churchyard. He gwine ter come once mo&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t
      gwine ter die till den, an&rsquo; dat time he&rsquo;s gwine ter be buried
      in de churchyard, and he won&rsquo;t come no mo&rsquo;, an&rsquo; den I&rsquo;ll
      pass away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A shout came through the dusk from the smithy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, mister, come; here&rsquo;s your horse.&rdquo; The other words
      were indistinguishable. I arose and started up the road reluctantly,
      longing to know more of the mystery. The old man again removed his cap,
      and so I left him, motionless, seated in the shadows, facing the faint
      glow in the west. My horse was ready when I reached the forge, the
      blacksmith standing dark and massive in the doorway. &ldquo;An old negro
      has just been telling me a remarkable story,&rdquo; I said after mounting;
      &ldquo;that there have been two suicides found hanging to the old oak, one
      long ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; answered the blacksmith, impassively and
      stolidly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t lived here very long myself. Always been
      called the &lsquo;Dead Oak&rsquo; ever since I knowed it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you know an old negro with a bushy white head and beard,
      who lives near the Brooke House? Who is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might be old Sam, or Lige, or Cash. Lots of &lsquo;em round here,&rdquo;
      answered the man, and that was all he would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mounted and rode off rapidly, for there were still six hours of travel
      before reaching my destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight was faint and chill, silvering the dry foliage of the old
      tree. I drew rein under it, and peered vainly into the shadows for the
      darker outlines of the old negro; he had disappeared, but it seemed to me
      he was still present, sitting on the gnarled root, with the pallid face of
      that young old corpse against his knee, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owl hooted. A faint light shone from the dim mansion in the fields,
      and I pressed on through a belt of low pines. When some distance on my way
      I turned and looked back. The glow of the smithy was hidden. All the low
      stretch of land was folded in twilight, and against the pale sky the Dead
      Oak stood spectral and alone.

    <h2>
      THE MAKING OF MONSIEUR LESCARBOT&rsquo;S BALLAD
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By William Holloway, Jr.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span> was a stormy
      evening of March, 1611. All day snow had fallen in a white whirlwind on
      Port Royal, winning one by one its points of vantage, and submerging each
      in turn relentlessly, till now the tiny colony had almost vanished in the
      drifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signs of outline there were none. The great stone gateway at the
      southeast, carven above with the fleur-de-lis, was dim and shapeless even
      to the sentry in the guard-room beside it; the bastion to the southwest,
      its four cannon quite buried, melted vaguely into the darkness. Snow lay
      everywhere. The gabled houses were turned into white misshapen monsters,
      and strange fantastic mounds stretched across the Square. Even the flag of
      France in the centre, beneath which the Seigneur of Port Royal stood each
      year to greet his vassals, had suffered with the rest, the wind having
      wrapped it tightly about its staff, and the interminable flakes blotted
      out its lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten by the clock, and the colonists long since abed, so that, save
      for the blink of the sentry&rsquo;s candle, a stranger passing by the
      guard-room would have seen no sign of life. But that was only because a
      giant drift hid the great hall of the seigneurie from sight, for there a
      few of them were still awake and drinking deep, in honor of the coming to
      Acadie of the Duc de Montpelier, cousin of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the long wainscoted room, Poutrincourt, Seigneur of Port Royal, sat
      musing before a huge log fire, with his thin white hands spread out to the
      mellow heat. His face, delicately contoured and crossed by many lines,
      gleamed with a ruddy hue while the flames roared up the high-arched
      chimney; when they sank low again, it had the likeness of an ashen mask
      against the blackness of his silken doublet. He was clad entirely in
      black, even to his ruffles. His head was sunken on his breast. And thus he
      sat gazing at the fire, his shadow on the wall behind keeping time
      grotesquely to the leaping flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his left Marc Lescarbot, the poet of the colony, listened across a bowl
      of muscat to one of Imbert&rsquo;s endless stories. He was tall and thin,
      with dreamy gray eyes; there were girlish dimples on his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now, however, his face was flushed and his fingers played nervously
      about his girdle, for Imbert, after a fashion of his own, was emphasizing
      the narrative with reckless flourishings of his naked sword. But even
      then, with the point almost upon his breast, Monsieur Lescarbot by no
      means lost his urbanity, for his smile, albeit a trifle anxious, was still
      most wondrous sweet. As for Imbert, the story he was telling had excited
      him beyond control. It was as if his wild sea-roving days had returned.
      His black eyes flashed fiercely from out his red, scarred face; his
      rubicund lips were protruded; his massive left hand was twined in the
      coarse black hair that overhung his forehead. As the firelight danced
      athwart him he seemed to Lescarbot, always fanciful, much like the gods on
      the bowls of the Indian lobster-claw pipes, so broad was his short, squat
      body and so flaming red his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right at a small table the Seigneur&rsquo;s son, Biencourt, and the
      Duc de Montpelier played at dice; the one eagerly, as if mindful of his
      growing pile of pistoles, the other in listless unconcern. And this
      difference the appearance of the two enhanced, for while Biencourt was
      tall, blue-eyed, and smooth and fresh of face, the duc was short and dark,
      with glittering black eyes and a pale, wearied countenance. And whereas
      Biencourt was bravely dressed in doublet and hose of soft blue satin, the
      duc wore a black velvet that harmonized sombrely with his paleness and his
      listlessness. He had but that day reached Acadie from France, yet the
      sight of the forest life about him, the fur-clad lackeys and strange
      Indian relics, seemed scarcely to stir his pulses. Instead he sat in
      silence by the table, carelessly toying with his white, ringed hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The round ended and Biencourt swept in his gains. &ldquo;Doubles?&rdquo;
      he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duc nodded and pushed forward his stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then the English came aboard us, Monsieur Lescarbot,&rdquo;
      roared Imbert, waving his sword, &ldquo;and I leave you to judge how
      fierce the fighting was with half our men already dead. The deck was a red
      shambles, and in the midst stood Pierre Euston, blood from head to heel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worthy of a ballad,&rdquo; murmured his hearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duc shivered and drew nearer the fire. &ldquo;Do ballads flourish in
      this frozen land?&rdquo; he asked, with a languid lift of his black
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poutrincourt started from his reverie. &ldquo;Lescarbot is a famous poet,
      monsieur le duc. For a ballad or love-song I know few to equal him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A blush reddened the poet&rsquo;s dimpled cheeks. &ldquo;The wilderness is
      full of subjects,&rdquo; said he, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was rising higher and the stout oaken door rattled clamorously to
      the white gusts. His highness the Duc de Montpelier shivered again and
      looked about him somewhat curiously at the quaintly carven doors and the
      bearskins and heads of deer that hung upon the dark wainscoted walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then I came up from the lower deck,&rdquo; went on Imbert,
      &ldquo;and side by side Pierre Euston and I charged together. Ah! Pierre
      was a brave fighter in those days, I warrant you, and together we swept
      the decks before us. And droll enough work it was, with the wounded dogs
      of English laying their swords about our heels as we passed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was scoundrelly work,&rdquo; broke in Biencourt, balancing his
      dice-box on his fingers. &ldquo;Nothing would please me better than a
      meeting with this droll gentleman, this Pierre Euston.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Half seriously, half amusedly, the quondam pirate shrugged his great
      shoulders. &ldquo;Tush! I was but a lad,&rdquo; he said in a tone of
      apology, &ldquo;and I took no share beyond the fighting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dicing went on. The duc threw and lost again and impassively as ever
      filled his silver flagon from the pitcher on the long oaken table behind
      him. &ldquo;To your next ballad, Monsieur Lescarbot,&rdquo; he said,
      politely. But the wine was scarce half way to his lips ere there came a
      strange interruption. The door opened slowly from without, and a woman
      entered, an infant in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In after years, when alone with Imbert in the ruined fort, that scene came
      back to Biencourt with startling vividness. Once again he beheld the long
      room dyed red in the glow of the fire; once more he saw them as they
      started to their feet and stood staring blankly at the stranger. And much
      cause was there to stare, for women in Port Royal this winter there were
      none,&mdash;least of all grand ladies, such as each movement showed this
      to be,&mdash;while beyond the fort lay naught but a savage, unbroken
      wilderness. And Biencourt remembered standing thus while one might slowly
      count ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duc was the first to speak. &ldquo;You are cold, madame,&rdquo; he
      said softly. &ldquo;You must drink some wine.&rdquo; And, flagon in hand,
      he approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the newcomer, who was blue-eyed and most marvellously fair of face,
      waved him curtly back. &ldquo;I have come to ask shelter for myself and
      babe, from the lord of the seigneurie, monsieur, not to drink wine.&rdquo;
      Then, pausing as if for breath, she stood erect beside the door, slender
      and lissome, a multitude of snow-flakes slowly melting in the red-gold of
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Poutrincourt was silent. Idly his thoughts travelled the
      endless forest wastes of Acadie, snow-clad and inhospitable, where, this
      winter of 1611, was no white settlement beside his own. He had even passed
      up the great river to Quebec, where his friend Captain Samuel Champlain
      had three years before planted the banner of the fleur-de-lis, when with a
      start he became aware the woman&rsquo;s eyes were fixed haughtily upon
      him. Then, mindful of his duty, he stepped forward, bowing low, and bade
      her welcome to his seigneurie of Port Royal, brushing the snow from her
      long fur mantle with his own white hands. And in an instant more the
      stranger was ensconced in a chair before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biencourt and the duc resumed their gaming, Monsieur Lescarbot took out
      his tablets preparatory to verse-making, and Imbert busied himself mulling
      wine for the conclusion of the evening&rsquo;s potations, which in Port
      Royal were wont to be of the deepest. But no one ventured to mar the
      hospitality of Port Royal with a question, and the newcomer proved more
      taciturn than would have been expected from the laughing curves of her
      lips, sitting moment after moment silent in the glow of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind still battered at the door and muttered angrily in the chimney,
      but to Biencourt the room was filled with a new light&mdash;a strange
      radiance that seemed to emanate from the stranger&rsquo;s golden head or
      the crimson kirtle which she wore. He forgot his game. He watched only her
      drooping lashes, with a vague hope that soon she might raise them. And as
      he watched, the pile of money before him lessened rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you bring me ill-luck, madame,&rdquo; he cried at last,
      ruefully smiling toward her. &ldquo;These pistoles have a sorry trick of
      vanishing since you came.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger raised her lashes, as he had hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled back responsively, and her eyes caught an amber light from the
      leaping flames. &ldquo;Would you turn me into the night again?&rdquo; she
      asked, jestingly, yet with a strange inflection in her voice as though
      speaking to some one far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biencourt shook his head. &ldquo;This may bring me fortune,&rdquo; he
      said, in eager tones. And rising and striding to her side, he stooped down
      and made the sign of the cross above the baby&rsquo;s forehead&mdash;a
      simple superstition, but evidently not to the newcomer&rsquo;s liking, for
      she said with some hauteur, &ldquo;I, monsieur, am of the reformed faith,&rdquo;
      and leaned back coldly in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks, madame, you cannot have journeyed far,&rdquo; broke in
      Poutrincourt, who had been staring into the fire. &ldquo;Your cloak had
      little snow for much travel, and, besides, there was the babe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame&rsquo;s face lost its haughtiness, and she smiled once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poutrincourt rubbed his slender hands softly together. &ldquo;All about us
      is the endless forest, and lo! as if by magic you appear! Are you sure
      there be no witchcraft in it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger&rsquo;s laugh rang through the hall, dying faintly amid the
      armor in the far corner. &ldquo;Mayhap I sailed hither in some sea-rover
      from the Spanish lands, or perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;and here she smiled
      demurely&mdash;&ldquo;I hid myself in yonder vessel that this day came
      from France. Perchance I dared the drifts alone, or I may have bribed some
      of the red savages to carry me. But where&rsquo;er I came from, the sentry
      at the gate is not to blame. The night is dark, and the snow has heaped an
      easy road from outside over the bastion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting, Monsieur Biencourt,&rdquo; broke in the duc, with an
      impatient glance at his opponent, who was still standing by the stranger
      lady&rsquo;s side. There was such anger in his tone that the other men,
      remembering his former listlessness, glanced curiously at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pale face was even paler than before; tiny drops of moisture glittered
      on his forehead; one hand was clenched above his winnings, in the other
      his dice-box trembled. &ldquo;Does he love his pistoles after all?&rdquo;
      thought the poet, pausing in his poem. The wine was mulled at last and the
      goblets filled. The Seigneur of Port Royal drank slowly and reflectively,
      in small sips, glancing alternately from the fair-haired mother to her
      dark-eyed, cooing child. &ldquo;I have thought about your lodging, madame,&rdquo;
      he said at last, tilting his goblet to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you would have no rest, else I would give you my own
      apartments. This evening we are something quieter than usual, but oftener
      the noise of revelling disturbs the forest far into the night. The hall is
      full of men in leathern hunting suits, the red savages sit smoking by the
      fire, there is gaming and wine-drinking, and in the intervals we sing the
      songs of France. But without the fort, a half-mile beyond the gate, are
      two disused huts. One of these I give you to inhabit. And that you suffer
      insult from none, a protector shall go with you, who shall answer for your
      honor with his own. There be two huts, and each shall have one. But this
      night you will lodge here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger leaned forward. Her slender fingers touched his arm. &ldquo;You
      have forgotten to name the one who is to guard me,&rdquo; she said
      hastily, a curious thrill vibrating through her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur pointed at Biencourt, and her face, which had seemed strained
      and eager, relaxed again. &ldquo;We shall be brave allies, shall we not?&rdquo;
      she cried, turning her blue eyes toward him. Biencourt laughed. &ldquo;None
      better,&rdquo; he responded in great good-humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm was growing fiercer as the night went on. The door rattled more
      noisily, and the flames in the great chimney waved to and fro in the
      sudden gusts. The space on the other side of the table, feebly lit by two
      candles in brazen candlesticks, became a battleground of shadows from the
      group before the fire. The stranger lady, seeming not to mind the storm,
      looked dreamily about her at the strange antlers on the walls, and at the
      motto of the lords of Port Royal, carved above the oaken mantel, shielding
      her baby&rsquo;s face the while from the glare of the flames. Presently
      her eyes met Biencourt&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are brave; is it not so?&rdquo; she asked, with a laugh and a
      toss of her head that spread her golden hair in sunshine over her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imbert answered in his place. &ldquo;Very brave, and a fine swordsman!&rdquo;
      cried the old pirate, while his black eyes flashed. &ldquo;All Port Royal
      knows the young admiral and his famous wrist-play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admiral!&rdquo; Again the blue eyes looked into his, and again
      Biencourt had the same strange feeling, as if the speaker&rsquo;s thoughts
      were far away, and she were merely toying with the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; went on Imbert, coming nearer, and laying his monstrous
      hands upon the mantel, &ldquo;the late King Henry made him an admiral for
      these waters months ere his martyrdom, and since then he has swept the
      freebooters from the coast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His highness the Duc de Montpelier leaned lazily backward in his chair,
      raising his black eyebrows. &ldquo;So my good cousin, Henry of Navarre,
      chose for his admirals beardless boys!&rdquo; he said very softly and very
      languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant hush throughout the room, in which the clatter of the
      door rose almost to a scream. Imbert drew in his breath with a sharp,
      hissing sound; the poet looked up from his tablets, and Poutrincourt from
      the fire. These latter were just in time to see Biencourt leap to his feet
      and draw his sword, and almost before they understood the cause the fight
      had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the encounter was much in the duc&rsquo;s favor. He fenced so
      strongly behind a certain affectation of disdain, and his thrusts came so
      subtly home, that, ere five minutes had passed, Biencourt was bleeding
      from a wound in his left shoulder. The duc lowered his sword and surveyed
      his opponent. &ldquo;Are you satisfied, monsieur?&rdquo; he asked
      placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; cried Biencourt, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imbert drew near and examined the wound. &ldquo;A scratch!&rdquo; he
      called, contemptuously. Then, with a warning look, he lounged back to his
      position by the mantel. The room was very still as the two faced each
      other again,&mdash;the duc, dark and pale; Biencourt, with a crimson flush
      upon his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the same writhing of swords, the same chilly music of steel, and
      once again the duellists swayed to and fro. Then for the second time the
      duc&rsquo;s sword found its mark; this time not far below the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biencourt leaned back, ashen white, upon Lescarbot&rsquo;s shoulder. His
      blood flowed fast and his eyes were closed as if in pain. The duc himself
      approached and surveyed him, leaning the while a trifle wearily upon his
      sword, for the last bout had been a fierce one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a brave fight,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his voice Biencourt&rsquo;s blue eyes opened. &ldquo;Can
      you stay the bleeding?&rdquo; he asked huskily of Imbert, who with the
      deftness of an old campaigner was binding a mass of soft cloths about the
      wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imbert nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then a moment more and I am ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur,&rdquo; the duc courteously interposed, &ldquo;your
      wound is deep and you have already done enough for honor. Believe me you
      have this night shown a swordsmanship I never saw before&mdash;I who have
      met and conquered every <i>maître d&rsquo;armes</i> in France. It was but
      by using all my skill I touched you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But with the duc&rsquo;s insult still rankling at his heart Biencourt was
      in no mood for fine speeches. &ldquo;I can try once more,&rdquo; he
      answered rather grimly, &ldquo;and I warn you to be on your guard. Let no
      gleam of the stranger&rsquo;s golden hair tempt you from your
      watchfulness, or ill may well betide you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the duc&rsquo;s pale face flushed and he shook his head in
      fiercest anger. But he spoke no word. Then the two faced each other again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poutrincourt&rsquo;s oval face was gray and haggard; Lescarbot looked on
      half eagerly, half sullenly; Imbert, his hands twined in his shaggy black
      hair, alone was imperturbable. And at one side, with head averted, the
      stranger leaned idly in her chair, smoothing her baby&rsquo;s forehead
      with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time there was no respite. The two pressed each other fiercely, their
      swords flashing in the candlelight like twin twining snakes. To and fro
      they swayed; a dozen times each saved his life as by a miracle; their
      breath came in quick and quicker gasps, and still they fought on. The duc&rsquo;s
      face was now fiery red with passion, and it was evident no thought of
      mercy lingered in his mind. And for the first time he became uncertain of
      the result, for Biencourt was fighting with a dogged persistence that
      boded ill. Try as he would, his thrusts were parried so that presently he
      began half doubtfully to wonder if at last he had met his equal. And while
      these thoughts lingered in his mind, giving to his wounded adversary&rsquo;s
      face a look of pale foreboding, the infant in the stranger&rsquo;s arms
      began crying shrilly. For an instant the duc glanced hastily toward the
      chair in which she sat, his guard failed, and Biencourt, fainting from
      loss of blood, ran him through the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was months ere Biencourt and the Duc de Montpelier met again. Then one
      June afternoon, when Acadie lay in a yellow swoon, the duc appeared before
      the two solitary huts, leaning heavily on a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not quarrel again, I hope,&rdquo; he said gayly, bowing to
      Biencourt, who was lounging in the shadow of the forest. &ldquo;Of a truth
      I have no mind to stay longer in bed. And I have come, monsieur, both to
      make amends for my discourtesy on the evening of our meeting, and to beg
      the honor of your friendship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And having thus spoken, he bowed low again and waited, a short yet stately
      figure set against a background of deep green spruce. But his face, as
      Biencourt sprang forward to grasp his hand, showed haggard and drawn as if
      through pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the beginning of a strange friendship. Lescarbot had turned the
      duel into a ballad of Homeric proportions, variegated here and there with
      choice allusions to the &ldquo;listless lady by the fire.&rdquo; This the
      two read together, seated side by side on a rustic seat Imbert had
      arranged in the shadow&mdash;all except the ending, which the poet,
      despite his skill, had not yet been able to fashion to his mind. Beneath
      them the bay sparkled in the sunshine; to the right lay the fort, with its
      gleaming cannon; in the distance a purple mountain ridge reared itself
      softly against the sky. Of this scene the duc seemed never to weary.
      Morning after morning he lounged for hours on the rustic seat, idly
      drinking in its beauty. It was at the second of these meetings he asked
      Bien-court about his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no trouble with these Port Royal gallants?&rdquo; he
      queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biencourt shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how does madame&mdash;Manette, the Seigneur told me was her
      name&mdash;how does madame relish her forest life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is thinner and her cheeks are pale. Since her child died, I
      fear she grieves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the duc sat silent, carelessly digging with his scabbard in the
      moist, black earth. &ldquo;One may not see her?&rdquo; he said at last,
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Without doubt you will respect her honor, and she seems
      lonely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the duc&rsquo;s lips a faint smile trembled. For a moment he seemed
      about to laugh. But he only repeated, &ldquo;So she seems lonely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Biencourt rose and knocked at the door of the adjoining hut. &ldquo;Does
      madame please to walk?&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a reply from within, inaudible to the duc&rsquo;s ears, and in
      another moment the stranger lady, whose plain name of Madame Manette ill
      consorted with her stately air, appeared equipped for walking. The duc
      sauntered near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Manette,&rdquo; said Biencourt, &ldquo;I have the honor to
      present to your notice his highness Monsieur le Duc de Montpelier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The duc&rsquo;s plumed hat swept the earth in greeting. &ldquo;Methinks
      the climate suits us strangers ill,&rdquo; he said, gayly. &ldquo;From
      your face it steals the roses; me it hinders too long of recovery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Manette shrugged her fine shoulders. &ldquo;Are you in danger?&rdquo;
      she asked politely. The subject was evidently uninteresting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duc shook his head and smiled. His black eyes were full of a strange
      light, and his lips quivered so that Biencourt, watching him, feared he
      might be in danger of overtaxing his new-found strength. Then the three
      set out through the forest, loitering along quaint footpaths brown with
      fallen pine needles, or stooping to gather wild flowers in the shelter of
      anciently bearded trees, where was naught but primeval stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walk that day, however, was a short one, for Madame Manette was weary,
      so that presently they found themselves again before the log hut, with its
      thatched roof and mossy walls. Vines of Imbert&rsquo;s planting were
      beginning to twine about the doorway, and in the air floated the dreamy
      scent of bursting pine buds. A half mile in the distance the four cannon
      on the bastion of Port Royal flashed brightly in the sunshine, and the
      flag of France flaunted civilization and progress in the face of the hoary
      forest; in a neighboring glade the conical wigwams of an Indian camp stood
      brown and lonely in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the doorway Madame Manette paused a moment before saying adieu; and as
      she leaned listlessly against the door, with her eyes fixed on the distant
      fort, the duc asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your baby!&rdquo; he cried, abruptly; &ldquo;where may its grave
      be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Manette&rsquo;s blue eyes were scanning the great stone gateway,
      and for a moment it seemed she had not heard. Then, without turning her
      head, she said slowly: &ldquo;It is buried where you stand. Your feet,
      monsieur, are above its heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her questioner moved hastily aside, a deep pallor on his cheeks, and
      Madame Manette went on calmly: &ldquo;It was my own choice it should lie
      there; and my feet, passing over it each day, do but make it rest the
      sweeter.&rdquo; Then, bowing slightly, she retired within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the duc joined in the walk again, and on many succeeding days,
      which was very natural, since he and Biencourt were constantly together.
      Indeed, now that he had shaken off his listlessness, he had become a most
      fascinating companion. To Biencourt he talked for hours of the court and
      its affairs; Imbert he held under a respectful spell with stories of his
      campaigns in the frozen north, where men perished by squadrons in the
      snowstorms. But his fascinations could hardly be said to extend to Madame
      Manette, who treated him throughout with a certain chilling disdain. His
      remarks she answered in monosyllables; the flowers he gave her she
      languidly let fall ere five minutes had passed. But, without a sign of
      discomfiture, he next day gathered more and talked on, unconcerned. Very
      frequently, too, he made excuses to speak to her alone, when the morning
      stroll was ended, and before she had entered the hut. On these occasions,
      which generally ended in her abrupt withdrawal, he betrayed a curious
      dread of stepping upon the unmarked grave, standing always much to one
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer waxed and waned upon the hillside, dying day by day in
      blood-red spots among the hardwood trees, and still Madame Manette
      lingered in Acadie. Her seclusion was more rigid than before; it might be
      that she was thinner, but that was all. At intervals, as vessels left for
      France, the Seigneur called to offer her passage home, which each time she
      smilingly refused, accompanying her refusal, however, with such liberal
      gifts to the colony&rsquo;s poor as sent Poutrincourt away in a maze of
      wonder. She took pleasure in her seclusion, she told Biencourt one day,
      when they were for an instant alone, and in their daily ramblings through
      the forest. It had been a strange experience, this summer on the very
      skirt of savagery, and her baby&rsquo;s grave had bound her to the place.
      But with the first snow she would return to France. And so time went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after many mornings, there at length chanced one when Madame Manette
      was indisposed, and there was no walking. Next day the same thing
      happened, to the evident annoyance of the duc, who paced for hours up and
      down before her door. On the succeeding morning, however, she appeared
      again, looking very white and frail. She declined to walk, on account of
      weariness, and spent an hour idly in the rustic chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are weak, madame,&rdquo; cried Biencourt, eagerly, as they
      walked back to her hut. &ldquo;You need aid. Indeed, you seem to grow ever
      frailer and more weary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Manette turned on the threshold of her domains and surveyed her two
      escorts with deliberation. There was a faint shadowy smile upon her lips,
      and her marvellous hair lay in a golden blaze against the white hollow of
      her cheeks. &ldquo;He dreams&mdash;does he not?&rdquo; she asked,
      addressing the duc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear his dreams are true.&rdquo; And Biencourt, glancing at him,
      thought he had never looked so ghastly since his wound. His lips were
      aquiver and his words came from them with a strange tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madame Manette shook her head. &ldquo;You are both over anxious,&rdquo;
      she said lightly, though even as she spoke her voice faltered wearily.
      Then, with a bow and a glance at some wild-fowl flying near, she closed
      the door behind her, leaving the two gazing at each other with a mute,
      fearful questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Biencourt chanced to be favored by a visit from Lescarbot. The
      poet had been wandering about the forest, vainly striving to fashion an
      ending to his famous ballad, and was consequently in a state of great
      depression. His figure drooped; his gray eyes stared moodily before him.
      And thus for hours he sat, while the moon rose above the trees and paled
      the solitary candle with her rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will never be an end,&rdquo; he cried at last, rising
      pettishly and flinging the door open wide. &ldquo;For months have I
      thought upon it&mdash;the wild storm, the dicing, the newcomer, and the
      duel&mdash;and each time I reel back, baffled like a child at the entrance
      of a gloomy forest. For who can paint the motive that daily forms itself
      beneath his gaze? And here is that which came perhaps from far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Lescarbot&rsquo;s troubled face relaxed. His analysis evidently
      pleased him well, for he stepped briskly into the moonlight flung across
      the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biencourt made no answer. He was busy with a long epistle, which a vessel
      on the morrow would carry to a certain black-eyed maid of honor at the
      court of France, and scarcely heeded what the poet said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From far! Who knows how far?&rdquo; Lescar-bot went on dreamily.
      &ldquo;Perchance from the royal&rdquo;&mdash;here he paused and crossed
      himself hastily, as heavy footsteps sounded near by. They came nearer
      still, and the poet drew in from the doorway, falling upon his knees in
      prayer. Biencourt sprang in wonder to his feet, and there, in the
      brilliant moonlight, a few feet from the hut, saw what had so transfigured
      his companion, a man bending laboriously beneath a heavy load&mdash;a load
      with lifeless limbs, and loose hair waving in the night wind. Then he
      knew, as the poet had known, it was the Duc de Montpelier with the dead
      form of Madame Manette upon his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment only the duc paused before he staggered across the threshold,
      and, shivering violently, laid the body on the floor. Yet in that moment
      the thought of his broken trust stung Biencourt like a lash, and half
      unconsciously his sword flashed in the moonlight. But ere he could frame
      the question surging to his lips, it was answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duc sank down beside the body, his left hand resting on the ashen
      face. &ldquo;You will seek to know the meaning of the riddle,&rdquo; he
      said mechanically, without lifting his eyes from off her rigid form.
      &ldquo;It is very simple. She was my wife. Nay, do not start, monsieur&rdquo;&mdash;as
      Biencourt made a gesture of amazement. &ldquo;It is as I say, and this is
      the body of Madame la Duchesse de Montpelier, wife of a prince of the
      blood, and&mdash;a Huguenot. And know you not&rdquo;&mdash;and here the
      duc spoke lower and his words came slowly, while he made the sign of the
      cross&mdash;&ldquo;know you not the Holy Father can disannul such
      marriages if it be the interest of the Truth? And among all the Huguenots
      of France&mdash;fierce and bitter as they have been and are&mdash;is there
      none more relentless than the comte, her father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour the duc spoke no word more. With his arms tightly clasped
      about his wife&rsquo;s stiffening form, he crouched beside her on the
      floor. And at the table near by the two unwilling spectators sat watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the duc spoke again, still with the same mechanical tone and with
      his eyes still fastened on her face. &ldquo;She came to Acadie without my
      knowledge, by the connivance of some of her own faith at Rochelle, as she
      herself told me, hiring a swift trading bark that dogged our course all
      the way, and landed her in the darkness below the fort. And ever since our
      meeting here has she been most bitter to me. She gave me no reproaches.
      She was too proud, if you understand, but each morning her eyes rested
      scornfully on me, as we left her at the door. Often, too, in the evenings,
      would I wander about her hut, watching her shadow pass to and fro across
      the window. Once I tapped lightly at the door, giving a secret signal we
      had often idly used in France, and she bade me depart so sternly I never
      ventured signal more. To-night it chanced I was standing not far from the
      window, when suddenly I heard her fall. In an instant I was within, but
      Manette was already dead. And now she is dead, monsieur,&rdquo; went on
      the duc, his eyes glittering feverishly as he tossed the golden hair
      caressingly to and fro, &ldquo;now she is dead, she is mine again. And I
      will bury her this night in a secret place I last week learned of, so that
      alien faces shall look on her no more, and where she shall slumber by the
      dust of dead Indian chiefs, and near the noise of a rushing stream. For it
      was by a brawling brook on her father&rsquo;s estate that we first met,
      and ever she loved its noises well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the night to Biencourt was always like a half-forgotten dream.
      Together he remembered they had borne the icy body the distance of a
      hundred yards, when, wearied from their recent wounds, he and the duc had
      come perforce to a sudden stop. It was then he had left the duc and
      Lescarbot with their burden, and, running to the fort, brought Imbert,
      yawning, to their aid. After that the journey was easy, for Imbert poised
      Madame Manette&rsquo;s body on his giant shoulders, easily as a mother
      might raise her child, and mile after mile bore it on through the waving
      forest. Port Royal, its bastion and palisades swimming in yellow
      moonlight, was left behind; the forest closed over them, dark and sullen,
      and still they pressed on. The duc went first, leading the way without
      hesitation, for the path was well marked, though in shadow, and even to a
      stranger impossible to miss. And by this the others knew they were going
      to the ancient sepulchre of the Indian chiefs&mdash;a place of mysteries,
      where strange influences had their hiding-places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray light of dawn was filtering coldly into the rocky well of
      sepulchre when they arrived. On all sides were niches in the walls, each
      niche a grave; and, drowning all voices in a hoarse clamor, a tiny stream
      fell thirty feet adown the rock into a murky pool below, whence a chasm in
      the cliff led it downward to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here they buried Madame Manette, erstwhile Duchesse de Montpelier,
      the duc praying long and fervently. And that none might look upon her face
      again, Imbert, going higher up the stream, changed its course by means of
      massive rocks, so that now and forever that brawling stream flows down
      across her grave. And here, with the vagrant spray falling thickly upon
      their faces, did the duc bind them by a fearful oath to guard his secret
      well from all save Poutrincourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, while the sun rose, they went slowly back to Port Royal through the
      lightening forest. The duc staggered weakly; his eyes were sunken; there
      was a grayness upon his face much like the grayness of the dead face he
      had looked at so long. Nor did he speak until the great gate of the fort
      loomed in sight, when, rousing himself as if from slumber, he said
      musingly, &ldquo;It is the ending of&mdash;a ballad, Monsieur Lescarbot.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>UDDENLY it dawned
      upon them that they loved one another. They had been talking about
      mind-reading, and he had looked long and steadily into her eyes when she
      had challenged him to read her thoughts. They realized simultaneously what
      had happened. She had known that she loved him, and he, that he loved her.
      But each had sought to keep that knowledge from the other. Now they could
      hide it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained silent for a long time, avoiding each other&rsquo;s gaze. At
      last their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; His voice expressed nothing; in his eyes
      there was sorrow and&mdash;hope!
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and he turned away his eyes; there was disappointment
      in them that he would not show. Then she said, very quietly, &ldquo;You
      have read my thoughts?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, still without looking at her; &ldquo;and you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears were in her eyes. If his, too, were wet, she could not see, for he
      was looking fixedly at a little pebble at her feet. At last he said,
      passionately, &ldquo;Oh, why did I meet you! Why should I suffer so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is it not worse for me? Is not my
      sin greater, and therefore my punishment heavier, than yours? Oh,&rdquo;&mdash;in
      answer to an impatient gesture of denial,&mdash;&ldquo;you will meet some
      woman whom it will not be a sin to love, and you will&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I will not,&rdquo; he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo; she said, very gently; &ldquo;and then&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head and gazed steadily at her. Then he said, challengingly,
      &ldquo;You wish me to love another?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked away from him and was silent. Gradually there crept into his
      eyes a look of hope; and hope was slowly turning into exultation when she
      spoke, so softly that he barely could hear her, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said, altogether too calmly, in too commonplace a manner, &ldquo;Oh,
      very well, since you wish it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she said, very firmly, &ldquo;I wish it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly they returned to the house. The sun was setting, and there was gold
      and nacre and glowing blood in the sky. In the garden the wind stirred the
      leaves gently, and there was sorrow in their song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband awaited them. &ldquo;Is n&rsquo;t it a beautiful sunset?&rdquo;
      he said to them from the piazza. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve been
      looking at it. You might write a sonnet about it, my boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up to the gray-haired man and kissed him on the lips, and leaned
      against him, until he wound his arm about her waist, and she rested her
      head on his shoulder caressingly; and then she looked defiantly at the
      young man, who had drawn near.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s hands closed tightly, and in his eyes there was
      disappointment and anger and some contempt. &ldquo;Yes, John, I believe I
      <i>could</i> write a few elegies on the death of this Sun, who has shed
      his blood in his fight with Night, and has spattered it all over the sky,
      so that the angels will have to wash it off with their tears. Sunsets are
      my forte, anyway&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen any of your verses,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may congratulate yourself upon your lucky escape.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray-haired man smiled good-naturedly and patted her cheek; and she
      held it up to be kissed, and nestled closer to him. Then she looked at the
      young man, and in her eyes there was still defiance, and, though she would
      not have shown it, some interest. She said, &ldquo;I have heard so much
      about them that I should like to read them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are reckless.&rdquo; And the bantering tone did not hide from
      her the significance that lay behind his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must show some of them to her,&rdquo; said the gray-haired man
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll hunt them up, some time, and send them to
      you,&rdquo; said the young man to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have n&rsquo;t you any here?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but they are all love songs, and
      therefore not worth the reading.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; she said. The gray-haired man patted her cheek
      indulgently. This time she did not upturn her face for a kiss. And in her
      voice there was an unnecessary indifference as she said to the young man,
      &ldquo;Will you let me read them to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he replied, laughingly, though his eyes were
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, because they are not worth anything; and then
      you might get an impression that I really meant what I wrote, and that I
      am deeply in love with some one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are not in love?&rdquo; There was a challenge in her voice.
      The gray-haired man smiled at her girlish, artless curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; the young man said decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But were you in love when you wrote them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Perhaps I
      was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> am,&rdquo; she said, looking at him steadily. And
      when his eyes had shown astonishment and had begun to shine with
      irrepressible hope, she continued: &ldquo;Indeed I am,&mdash;with my own
      dearest husband, who is so good to me. Am I not, darling?&rdquo; And she
      entwined her arms about the gray-haired man&rsquo;s neck and kissed him on
      the lips twice. And the gray-haired man laughed and looked pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s face was rigid and very pale. In the dusk they could
      not see that his lips were twitching. But she had grown strangely quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great stillness had fallen upon the world. The evening star was shining
      very brightly now, and in the east a little lone star was blinking
      tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she said, &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray-haired man drew her closer to him, kissed her, and said: &ldquo;Afraid
      of what, little coward? But come, it is time to go in, my child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s thoughts had been many during the brief spell of
      silence that had preceded her words, and now he said: &ldquo;Yes, <i>little
      sister</i>, you ought to go in now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray-haired man laughed good-naturedly at this jest of his young
      brother&rsquo;s. But she drew a quick breath and went into the house
      hurriedly.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he gray-haired man
      was nodding over his newspaper in the library. She had just ceased to hold
      the latest novel upside down in her hands. She hesitated for a moment;
      then she arose, saying: &ldquo;It is so warm here; I am going on the
      piazza.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray-haired man started. &ldquo;What &lsquo;s that, my dear?&rdquo; he
      asked, shamefacedly. He feared that she might think he had been asleep.
      They had been married but four months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to sit on the piazza; it&rsquo;s cooler,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Dick there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then. But don&rsquo;t stay too long; the night air is
      not good for you.&rdquo; It certainly was not good for him, so he remained
      in the library nodding over his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the piazza. Sitting on the veranda-rail, the young man was
      smoking. At the sound of her steps he started up eagerly; but when she was
      near him, his eyes showed nothing, his face was calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful night, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he acquiesced. He stifled a yawn ostentatiously. Then,
      as though the thought had just struck him, &ldquo;Shall I fetch you a
      chair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thanks; I am going upstairs shortly,&rdquo; she said, with
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I fetch you a chair?&rdquo; This in another tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, and then resumed his seat on the veranda and smoked in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead, the sky was as molten sapphire and the stars seemed more
      numerous than ever before, and brighter and nearer to the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sky, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence she said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen so many stars
      before; have you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;there was one more last night,&mdash;mine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause,&mdash;a long one. She was looking at a little
      star that was shining very faintly low in the sky. Finally she said,
      softly, &ldquo;Show me your verses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he said, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; She avoided his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I ask you as a great favor&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should still refuse,&rdquo; he said, wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very rude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are very cruel,&rdquo; he returned, monotonously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not so cruel as you,&mdash;to arouse a woman&rsquo;s curiosity,
      and then to refuse, absolutely, to gratify it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so it is merely curiosity?&rdquo; His voice trembled slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated; her foot was tapping on the ground nervously. Then, as if
      she had weighed the consequences, she said: &ldquo;Of course, merely
      curiosity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you lied this afternoon, and you are only a coquette? I might
      have known it!&rdquo; He spoke with difficulty for his teeth were clinched
      tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you speak to me so?&rdquo; she said, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he answered in a low voice, as if fearful of being overheard:
      &ldquo;And how dare you forget that you are my brother&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a half-smothered cry of pain, as though he had struck her. Then
      she buried her head in her hands and sobbed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&mdash;Please don&rsquo;t&mdash;Oh, don&rsquo;t&mdash;Gladys&mdash;&rdquo;
      he said. It was the first time he had called her thus, by name, and she
      said, between her sobs: &ldquo;Oh, I am so unhappy, so unhappy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head and looked at him. Her eyes were filled with tears. He
      went toward her hesitatingly. By her side he paused; his hands were
      clinched and held close to his face. He said hoarsely: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.
      Don&rsquo;t make&mdash;me&mdash;forget&mdash;&rdquo; He drew nearer; she
      held up her arms as if to ward off a blow, and then the gray-haired man&rsquo;s
      voice called out sleepily from a window on the other side of the cottage:
      &ldquo;Gladys! Dick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better come in now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Coming.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t breakfast the
      next morning the young man said: &ldquo;I am going back to the city this
      morning, John.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? When will you return?&rdquo; said the gray-haired man. He
      did not think his honeymoon had waned yet; but it never shines very
      brightly on three people at once, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the young man. &ldquo;I shall
      go to Jack Livingston&rsquo;s first; I promised to spend a week or two
      with him. And then I think I&rsquo;ll go to Maine. I am told the fishing
      is exceptionally good this season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing. The gray-haired man began to talk about the anxious
      cares of a floriculturist.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast she disappeared. The gray-haired man said good-bye to his
      younger brother, to whom he had been as a father, and went out to consult
      with his head gardener about a new variety of orchids which he had just
      received from the Isthmus of Panama.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that morning the young man wondered if she would not bid him farewell.
      At last the groom came to tell him that the cart awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the hallway, deliberating whether he should seek her, when she
      came down the stairs slowly. Her face wore a look it had never known
      before. Occasionally it is seen on some women when they wear the widow&rsquo;s
      garb for the first time,&mdash;a blending of sorrow and yearning, and,
      withal, resignation. She halted at the foot of the stairs, her hand
      resting upon the carved post. &ldquo;So you are going?&rdquo; she said,
      monotonously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; His voice was low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a long time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He dared not look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for the best,&rdquo; she said. He answered nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom came to the door and said: &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but
      the train is due now, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave two sharp little indrawn gasps. Then, speaking very quickly, she
      said: &ldquo;Wear this. My mother gave it to me when I was confirmed. When
      she died I took it off because it reminded me of her and it made me cry.
      It is sacred to me. It is all I can give you. I am sure she would not
      blame me&mdash;&rdquo; She paused and looked at him questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it!&rdquo; She held a little ring, a plain gold band, toward
      him, and he took it and with some difficulty placed it on his little
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her imploringly. His lips dared not utter what his eyes told
      so plainly. It was a request, nothing more, but she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she repeated, extending her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it and held it tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said. Her hand remained in his. She could not
      withdraw it and there were tears in her eyes as she said, gently, for the
      last time: &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said again. He bent over to kiss her hand, but
      she drew it back quickly. Then she went up the stairs slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had resolved not to look back, but before the little cart had gone two
      hundred yards he turned his head. There was no one on the piazza, and her
      windows being curtained he could not tell whether she was looking at him
      from her room. He gazed long towards the little cottage. Then, as he heard
      the whistle of the approaching train, he turned his eyes to the front, and
      his face took on a calm, resolute look.

    <h2>
      A WOMAN&rsquo;S LIFE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Anthony Leland
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E is dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Miss &lsquo;Lizbeth! and you alone with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was alone with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said this in a manner which seemed to imply that there was nothing
      strange in the fact that she was alone with him. She was always alone with
      him, was she not? Was it necessary that she open the doors and call them
      all in because he was dying?
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed from the narrow hall into the front room with its green-paper
      window-shades, its worn carpet and meagre furniture. His bed had been
      moved down from the floor above when his last illness had seized him, and
      here it had remained, a black walnut bedstead, with towering head-board,
      which shut out the light from one of the two windows in the room. This
      bedstead had been one of his few, his very few, extravagances in years
      gone by, and in its dark shadow he lay now rigid. He had been a stern,
      grizzled man in life, but the sternness then had been as very softness
      compared with the hard, cold outline of the lace now upon the pillow in
      the green light of the lowered window-shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved about the room on tip-toe, speaking in the hissing whispers
      considered appropriate by them in the presence of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo; some one asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-hour ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had n&rsquo;t I better call the doctor or the minister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what good they&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another woman crept in silently, a shawl huddled about her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest heard,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited in silence for her to go on. She was the woman of the village
      who always officiated at the &ldquo;laying out&rdquo; of their dead. The
      reason for this no one had ever sought. Possibly the right was hers
      because she so enjoyed the grewsome privilege. At least she clung to it
      tenaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miss &lsquo;Lizbeth, you jest go upstairs and I&rsquo;ll tend
      to things,&rdquo; she said, while the other women awaited her commands,
      half resenting her cool assumption of control, but with a full
      consciousness of her capability in &ldquo;tending&rdquo; to such &ldquo;things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bare little church, with its white walls and staring windows, its
      stiff pine pulpit painted a dingy yellow, with the minister&rsquo;s green
      upholstered chair behind it, was well-filled the day of the funeral. A
      &ldquo;burying&rdquo; was not a thing to miss without grave cause. There
      were old men and old women in the congregation who had not missed a
      funeral within ten miles of them for fifty years. They sat solemnly
      waiting for the minister to begin the services, taking close notice of the
      coffin and calculating its cost. Not a difficult problem for them with
      their long experience. They also noted closely the appearance of the one
      mourner who sat directly in front of the pulpit, alone save for the
      presence in her pew of the woman who had come to her huddled under a
      shawl. This strange woman always sat with the mourners as though she felt
      a claim upon the bodies of the dead until their final surrender to mother
      earth. But the dead man&rsquo;s daughter sat away from her companion quite
      at the farthest end of the seat, as if she would be as much apart from
      them all in her present loneliness as she had been before. It was fifteen
      years since she had sat with them in the church, and they looked at her
      now with curiosity. A slight little woman, with tired eyes and dull brown
      hair streaked with gray!
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister arose and folded upon the open Bible his lean hands with
      their great veins and yellow joints. He prayed long and laboriously, his
      voice rising from a doleful sing-song drawl into a shout and then sinking
      into a whisper. They wagged their heads knowingly in the pews and
      whispered to one another that it was a &ldquo;pow&rsquo;ful effort.&rdquo;
      Toward the close of his prayer many eyes were turned expectantly toward
      the woman who sat alone. The minister was calling loudly for &ldquo;the
      lost sheep who is not with us safe in the shelta&rsquo; of Zion&rsquo;s
      walls. O Lord!&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;make yoh wahnin&rsquo; plain to
      her onseein&rsquo; eyes that she may seek safety from the wrath to come.&rdquo;
      If the woman heard or understood his words no acknowledgment of that fact
      touched her thin face. She sat with folded hands, her eyes upon the narrow
      front of the box like pulpit. Then the minister began his sermon. From the
      earliest dawn of the dead man&rsquo;s life, through his childhood, youth,
      and manhood unto the last moment of his old age the speaker journeyed,
      going unctuously over the dreary details of the meagre, common history.
      They all knew it well enough, but they listened greedily, jealously
      fearful that the speaker might overlook a single incident in the man&rsquo;s
      dull story. When he had exhausted every period of his subject&rsquo;s
      life, the minister began the apotheosis of the man. His goodness, his
      charity, his uprightness, and, above all, his &ldquo;tireless labors in
      the vineyard of the Lord&rdquo; were dwelt upon. He had in truth been
      cruel and hard and mean. They all knew this, but he had lived and died
      &ldquo;a member in good standing,&rdquo; and any other treatment of his
      character by the preacher would have been a scandalous thing, unheard of
      and not to be forgiven. At the close of his discourse the minister turned
      his colorless eyes upon the woman who sat apart. &ldquo;There was,&rdquo;
      he said, his voice falling into a slow and solemn drawl, &ldquo;there was
      one cross which our Lord and Master seen fit to bind upon the shoulders of
      the brother who has jest gone befoh us into the glory of the Heavenly
      Kingdum. A cross hard to bear, a cross whose liftin&rsquo; he had wrestled
      for with the Lord Jesus often and mightily in prayer. But which Divine
      Providence seen fit to allow to remain upon the shoulders of his faithful
      son. It was, my brothers and sisters, the refusal of the only one of his
      kin to accept the Lord, to wash herself in the blood of the Lamb, to join
      with those who journey onward safe in the arms of Jesus into the glory of
      everlastin, life.&rdquo; His voice had risen into a shout. &ldquo;The
      night is comin&rsquo;, the day is almost done. Oh! let us pray for them
      who falters and will not turn from the wrath of God befoh it is too late.&rdquo;
      His voice sank suddenly into a whisper, and the words &ldquo;too late&rdquo;
      went hissing out over the heads of the people who sat with craning necks
      and knowing faces cruelly turned toward the woman, whose eyes for a single
      instant had not left the front of the dingy yellow pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hearse, with the one closed carriage of which the village boasted,
      moved slowly away from the church along the muddy road, followed by a
      straggling line of wagons. The majority of the people lingered about the
      church door watching the woman who sat stiffly erect in the carriage, the
      minister facing her, at her side the woman who seemed to have so strange a
      love for the dead. This woman sat with her handkerchief pressed to her
      eyes as if she must needs make amends for the other&rsquo;s stony
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road, after leaving the village in the bottom lands along the river,
      wound up the side of the bluff upon which the burying ground was situated.
      It was an autumn day, and the golden haze of that most glorious of seasons
      in the Missouri valley bathed the wide stretch of country upon which the
      cemetery looked down. A sky of marvellous blue spread its canopy above
      them, while the bright glow of the western sun brought out in pitiless
      detail the dreary little home of the dead with its crude tiptilted
      monuments and scattered, sunken graves, its rays enfolding with no
      mellowing touch the group of sallow-faced men and women in rusty and
      shapeless garb who clustered about the newly made grave. They lifted their
      voices and sang quaveringly amid the strangely death-like stillness of the
      declining day. It was a dismal tune in plaintive minors, and as they
      dragged it out in unmusical and uncertain tones it seemed a fitting symbol
      of their narrow, unlovely lives. When the last clod of reddish clay had
      fallen upon the oblong mound, they turned and walked away to leave their
      dead unnoticed until another of the living should pass from the grimness
      of life into the&mdash;to them&mdash;greater grimness of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the procession crawled along the heavy road toward the cluster of
      houses upon the river&rsquo;s bank, the minister, his great hands resting
      upon his knees, his pale eyes blinking solemnly, began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;E-eliz&rsquo;beth, you are left alone now.&rdquo; She nodded her
      head in affirmation. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t much of this world&rsquo;s
      goods.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept two of us from starvin&rsquo; for five years. I
      reckon I can keep myself,&rdquo; she replied stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yoh father was well-fixed once, but the Lord seen fit to deprive
      him of his earthly treasures that he might lay more store by them gifts
      which is above earthly price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a graspin&rsquo; man and over-reached himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman beside her sniffed reproachfully and glanced at the minister
      with sorrowful air. The man stirred uneasily and lifted a hand in
      expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A daughter shouldn&rsquo;t jedge. If you was enlightened by the
      spirit you would n&rsquo;t be so lackin&rsquo; in Christian charity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had endured much that long afternoon, and she raised her eyes now
      defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my duty by him&mdash;I&rsquo;ve done my duty for
      twenty years without complainin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pride of the onregenerate must be humbled,&rdquo; returned the
      minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      She vouchsafed no reply, and they went on in silence, the setting sun
      touching with softened light her worn face and tired eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was low in the western sky when the two women reached the small
      house, once white but now a dirty gray, with great yellow streaks
      following the lines of the overlapping clapboards. The black waters of the
      swiftly flowing river were flecked with red and gold under the level rays
      of the sun, the rounded hills on the other side of the stream were softly
      blue, toward the east a white fog was rising. A flock of wild geese high
      in the gray-blue sky was flying swiftly southward, spread out in a great
      straggling V. The mournful cry of their leader reached the two women
      faintly, the flight of the wild geese was an unfailing sign of approaching
      winter, and they watched the black lines of the flying fowls until they
      vanished in the southern sky, their weird cry growing fainter and sadder
      and finally dying away, leaving the swish of the river against its muddy
      bank the only sound which troubled the quiet of the autumn twilight. Two
      women with hushed voices and funereal faces waited inside the dingy front
      room of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a right smart gathering,&rdquo; said one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never see a finer,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the minister was mighty pow&rsquo;ful,&rdquo; ventured the
      third in mournful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at the dead man&rsquo;s daughter expectantly. Common decency
      surely required some expression of gratified approval of the congregation
      and the sermon. But she was folding her shawl carefully, laying it upon
      the bed alongside her rusty bonnet. She seemed not to have heard their
      voices. Then she sat stiffly by the window looking out at the mud-clogged
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you feel reconciled, Miss &lsquo;Lizbeth,&rdquo; one of the
      women began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I am. He&rsquo;s been awful hard to take care of,&rdquo;
      she replied with her hard honesty. She turned her eyes away from the
      window and looked wearily at her visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s supper time. There ain&rsquo;t any use of your stayin&rsquo;
      with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The three women arose, angry at their dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed you&rsquo;d want some one to stay with you the first
      night,&rdquo; said one of them with a lugubrious sniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;ve got all the nights of my life to stay alone in. I
      &lsquo;bout as well begin now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched them as they went away through the deepening gloom, their
      heads together nodding wisely. They were talking about her, of course. She
      knew well enough what they said. She knew how hard and strange and
      unfeeling they were calling her. And as she sat alone by the window she
      wondered whether she was all these. The bed in its dark corner brought to
      her mind the picture of the man who had first quit it for his narrow bed
      upon the hillside. She fancied that she saw his hard, thin, yellow face
      upon the pillow now; that she heard his querulous voice demanding her
      attention, upbraiding her for some fancied forgetfulness, fiercely
      denouncing her for her lack of &ldquo;religion.&rdquo; How hard he had
      been! As the woman&rsquo;s thoughts travelled back along the years she
      could not recall one kind word, one touch of thankfulness for her
      unremitting care, for her absolute immolation of life, hope, love upon the
      altar of &ldquo;duty.&rdquo; Twenty years! what a long time it seemed!
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed into the back room and pressed close to the little square
      looking-glass which hung against its wall. The daylight was well-nigh
      gone, but she could yet discern the reflection of her face against the
      background of gray twilight. How old she looked! How sallow she had grown!
      There were great lines about her mouth and deep furrows between her eyes.
      And her hair,&mdash;how dingy it was with its streaks of yellowish gray!
      Twenty years ago she had been proud of her hair. It had been bright and
      soft. She was twenty years old then, and there were roses in her cheeks,
      and her eyes, so pale and tired now, had been blue and fresh then. She
      wondered if she had wept their color and their brightness away. Perhaps
      that was the reason no tears were left for her father. She had shed them
      all long ago for the man whom she had loved and given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not return to the front room where the great bed loomed so weirdly
      in the gloom, but sat by the one window in the little back room, half
      kitchen, half dining-room, looking out upon the river growing blacker and
      colder in the falling night as it flowed from out of the west where a
      rapidly diminishing, dull red streak marked the track of the vanished sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty years since her mother died and her sister, selfish in her new life
      as a wife, had said that &lsquo;Lizbeth&rsquo;s duty lay in their father&rsquo;s
      house. He might marry again or die in a few years. Surely it was not so
      hard for a young girl to wait. So she had waited, her lover fretting as
      lovers will, until one day she had awakened to the fact that a man&rsquo;s
      patience is not like a woman&rsquo;s. There had been one awful night which
      she remembered after all these years with a shudder. A night when, for the
      first and only time in her hard life, she had turned hotly upon the stern
      old man and told him of her love and of her wrecked girlhood, praying
      wildly for some help, for some sympathy. She caught her breath sharply now
      as she recalled her father&rsquo;s bitter words. That same night her lover
      left. Fifteen years had come and gone since then. The great world had
      taken him, and whether he lived or had been claimed again by mother earth
      the woman who sat and dreamed of the past alone in the dusk knew naught of
      him. She had practised a woman&rsquo;s faithfulness; she had reaped a
      woman&rsquo;s hard reward. Afterwards her sister died and left to her care
      a blue-eyed babe. How she had poured out upon that baby boy the pent up
      mother-love within her. But the gods in their wisdom had taken him too. In
      this still night as she lived over again the years which were gone, she
      seemed to feel the clasp of those baby arms about her neck and to hear the
      crooning of that soft baby voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the long years of her father&rsquo;s illness when she knew
      no moment of rest or peace. It had been a long struggle between a loveless
      woman on one side and gaunt starvation upon the other without one word of
      gratitude to strengthen her. And they called her hard because she could
      not weep! She looked at her hands, holding them up close to her face. How
      misshapen and ugly from toil they were!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite dark now and the river murmured strangely under the wind
      which was creeping down from the north. Her hands fell back into her lap
      and two great tears coursed slowly down her worn face&mdash;not for the
      man who lay under the stars in the little cemetery on the hill, but for
      her own vanished youth and love and hope.

      &ldquo;WHEN THE KING COMES IN&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Anthony Leland
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>HE slunk along in
      the shadows listlessly, staring with unheeding eyes at the shuffling
      crowds upon the sidewalks, at the fly-blown, tawdry splendors of the shop
      windows, and at the yellow gloom of the pawn-shop. The autumn wind swept
      sharply up from the river, and she drew her old plaid shawl about her
      tightly with one hand, while with the other she covered her swollen and
      discolored cheek. The sidewalks and roadway were covered with a thin,
      slippery coating of mingled filth and mud. An autumn mist, heavy with
      smoke, pressed itself tightly down upon the street, deadening the light of
      the electric lamps at the corners into mere splotches of a dully-luminous
      gray. Frowsy, palefaced girls hung about dark doorways where they bandied
      mirthless jests with lounging men and boys. In front of a bar-room, whence
      came the fangling notes of a piano and the scream of a high-pitched
      soprano voice, a man stood and urged the passers-by to go in and witness
      &ldquo;the dizziest &lsquo;vawdyville&rsquo; in the city.&rdquo; The woman
      in the old plaid shawl passed him without heeding his blatant voice. She
      had heard his sing-song shout many times; the &ldquo;dizzy vawdyville&rdquo;
      was nothing new. There never was anything new in Myrtle Street; it was
      ever the same ugly, sordid, joyless place day and night, week in and week
      out. It was always crowded with people, but it was always strangely sullen
      and mirthless. You never heard any one laugh there. At times when some one
      slipped and fell upon the slime of the pavement, or when one of the
      white-faced girls hurled shrill defiance at a man or at her companions, a
      hoarse human bark rent the air, but it was not a laugh. Even the children,
      who scrambled in the gutters and crept in and out of the dark alleys,
      forgot to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman with swollen and discolored cheek, who was crawling along in the
      shadows, halted in front of a dram-shop on a corner, and gazed doubtfully,
      longingly, at its swinging door. She was wondering if perchance Red Mike
      would trust her for a drink. She felt keenly the chill air from the river.
      She was strangely weary and down-hearted, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier in the evening she and her man had quarrelled. He was drunk, as
      usual, and had struck her, but for some unaccountable reason she had not
      screeched and struck back and tried to claw his face. She had simply
      grabbed her old shawl and escaped into the street, where she had wandered
      about for an hour. It was very odd that she had acted thus, and now she
      was shamefaced about asking Red Mike for a drink of whiskey! He got all
      their meagre earnings, anyway, did Red Mike, and he was usually easy
      enough about donating a dram or two when they were down in their luck, and
      heretofore she had n&rsquo;t minded asking him. And if he chanced to
      refuse, she eased her mind by a good mouthful of curses, which she spat at
      him like a cat. But tonight she was foolishly squeamish about asking him;
      she feared the loafers about the bar would jeer at her if he refused; her
      face pained her where Con&rsquo;s blow had fallen, and she was cold and
      shivering, and&mdash;well, she was losing her nerve. So she turned away
      from the hot glow of the bar-room door and passed on into the mists of the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she crawled along there came to her ears a quick thud of a drum-beat
      and the sound of men and women&rsquo;s voices singing. Marching through
      the gloom they came, a flapping banner above their heads, the red shirts
      of the men and the blue, scarlet-banded bonnets of the women lending for a
      moment a patch of color to the dim dinginess of the street. Suddenly they
      paused and fell upon their knees in the road, while a man&rsquo;s voice
      wailed out a prayer. Time was when Myrtle Street gibed at the
      Salvationists and threw rocks at them and hustled them about. But that was
      when the red shirts and the flapping banner were something new. The
      newness was gone now, and Myrtle Street merely shuffled indifferently
      past, and the beat of the big drum, the strident voices of the exhorters
      were quite as much a part of the night sounds of the place as the bawling
      of the showman or the chatter of the frowsy girls. The woman, shivering
      under her shawl and fondling her bruised cheek, glanced apathetically at
      the kneeling men and women, when quickly her eyes became fixed upon the
      face of one of them whom she knew. It was Maggie, the girl who once
      occupied a dark little hole of a room next her own in the big tenement
      house where she yet lived. Maggie! a forlorn, starving thing of whom she
      had lost track entirely&mdash;in truth, she had not thought of her since
      the day when the poor, sniveling, pale-faced creature had been turned into
      the street for not paying her rent. Myrtle Street does not waste much time
      in tracing the whereabouts of unfortunate acquaintances, nor in thinking
      of them after they drift out of sight under the ever-mounting wave of
      disaster which laps hungrily thereabout. But Maggie in a big bonnet, with
      her eyes closed and kneeling in the mud, was enough to arouse Myrtle
      Street&rsquo;s benumbed curiosity. So the bedraggled woman on the sidewalk
      pressed quite close to the curb and stared at her, wondering vaguely at
      the transformation. The man ended his prayer, and his companions, rising
      to their feet, began to sing again. The woman on the curb took no heed of
      the words which they sang. She was not for some moments vividly conscious
      of the song at all; she was conscious only of being tired and cold. Her
      curiosity regarding Maggie was dying, and she loitered with the little
      group which huddled upon the curb, simply because she had nowhere else to
      go. But as she stood there in the mist with her sunken eyes staring
      vacantly into the night, the music which touched her ears began to affect
      her oddly. It was a curious, wailing melody, with a barbaric accompaniment
      of jingling tambourines, and as its monotonous, insistent swing beat the
      air a strange feeling of awakening began to stir her dull veins. She
      weaved to and fro a little in unison with the measure of the song. She
      closed her eyes and felt a tightening in her throat. She clutched her
      shawl. She felt a wild desire to cry out or sob. Suddenly they ceased to
      sing, and she opened her eyes with a start. Maggie stepped into the little
      semi-circle of men and women, and in high, hard tones began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Those is great, great words, my friends, which we have just
      sung,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;awful words! Terrifyin&rsquo; words! Did you
      hear &lsquo;em? Did you understand &lsquo;em? Did they come home to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When the King comes in,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Like lightning&rsquo;s flash will that instant show
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Things hidden long from friend and foe.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Just what he is will each one know,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      When the King comes in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it! Think of it! Like a flash will it be, and you will
      know and I will know&mdash;everybody will know just what we are. Oh! It is
      awful! Like lightning&rsquo;s flash will that coming be&mdash;remember
      that! Don&rsquo;t try to believe it is far off. It isn&rsquo;t. It may be
      to-night. It may be within an hour&mdash;a minute&mdash;a second, for you
      and me. But be it near or far, it&rsquo;s coming, coming, coming!&rdquo;
      Her voice shrilled piercingly, and the woman, listening so intently upon
      the curb, felt a thrill of excitement at the sound. It was not clear to
      her what it all meant, but she had a queer feeling of awe as she looked at
      Maggie&rsquo;s drawn face and listened to her strained, sharp voice.
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; the girl continued, &ldquo;think of it! Think if He
      comes to-night and finds you in all your sin and wickedness and filth.
      Think, think and be afraid. Think, and before it&rsquo;s too late, get
      saved! I am saved, and I thank God to-night for it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A low chorus of &ldquo;Glory to God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe!&rdquo; came from her companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to-night to stand here to tell you that I am saved and
      happy&mdash;oh! so happy! Why do you wait? Some of you know me&mdash;I was
      sinful and tired and afraid once, but not now, thank God! not now. I&rsquo;m
      saved, saved, saved!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Louder and wilder grew the girl&rsquo;s cry. She waved her arms violently,
      and paced rapidly to and fro. The listening woman shifted her position
      from the sidewalk to the gutter. Her hands loosened their clutch upon her
      shawl; she wrung them constantly as she looked with wondering eyes at
      Maggie&mdash;Maggie who was n&rsquo;t tired nor afraid any more, and was
      happy, and all because she was &ldquo;saved&rdquo;! What did it all mean?
      How had it happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stopped abruptly in her walk, and, as though answering her
      thought, cried, &ldquo;It is so easy to get saved, too. All you have to do
      is to throw yourself on your knees and call on Jesus, and give yourself up
      to Him, and all your sins and fears and troubles and burdens are gone, and
      you&rsquo;ll be happy and glad and free and saved forever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a pause her voice shot into the song which they had sung before;
      but now its measure was changed to a clear, quick chant, with which she
      kept time by a soft patting with her hands. Clearer and higher grew her
      tones, and her companions, sinking to their knees, moaned in hushed voices
      a weird accompaniment, while the gently shaken tambourines lent again
      their strange barbaric rhythm, marked from time to time by the great drum&rsquo;s
      muffled beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer and nearer to the semi-circle of kneeling figures stole the
      listening woman. Tears were streaming from her eyes, her blue lips
      quivered, a great sob tore itself from her tight throat. At length she
      stood quite within the lines of the singers, and then, with a strange,
      wild cry, she, too, fell upon her knees in the slime of the street. Her
      old shawl fell from her head, her arms rested upon the drum, her swollen
      face was buried in them. A great shout of &ldquo;Glory to God!&rdquo; went
      up about her, and some one on the curb cried amazedly, &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s
      old Kit!&rdquo; But she heard only that monotonous wailing voice chanting
      stridently &ldquo;When the King Comes In.&rdquo; Afterwards there came a
      knowledge of some one&rsquo;s arm across her shoulders, of whispered words
      and urgent voices, a sensation of being lifted to her feet and helped
      along the street, and then a confusing blur of yellow light from oil lamps
      in a dingy hall. And at length full consciousness, dull fatigue, and an
      overwhelming desire for sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggie and one of the brothers in red jersey and jaunty cap walked home
      with her, pouring into her ears encouraging advice in strange, cant words,
      which she but half understood. At the doorway of the human hive where she
      and Con slept and fought and starved the man looked sharply at Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;they&rsquo;re married,&rdquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come to the barracks early to-morrow morning?&rdquo; he
      asked, turning to Kit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She promised to do so, and, passing into the dark hall, climbed upward to
      where Con lay in drunken stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning Kit stepped into a new world&mdash;a world of
      friendly words and close companionship. The squalidly poor know nothing of
      that luxury called friendship. They are huddled together in vast crowds,
      squeezed and packed by scores within narrow limits, jostled and elbowed by
      their kind at every turn. They are suffocated by close association. But of
      fellowship, of interest in one another&rsquo;s aims, of sympathy with one
      another&rsquo;s hardships, they know nothing. Like starving dogs over a
      bone, they growl and snarl and fly straight at throats. So, when Kit crept
      half sullenly into the barracks and was greeted by a loud chorus of
      interested questions and by unstinted praise, the unfamiliar warmth of
      friendly words thawed into life her sluggish sensibilities. And, too, an
      entirely new view of herself and the world was suddenly opened to her
      bewildered gaze,&mdash;for the first time in her hard life she was looked
      upon as a human being of some importance. They told her that she was
      suddenly become different from her kind, she was better than they, she was
      &ldquo;saved.&rdquo; Not only that, but she must &ldquo;save&rdquo;
      others. She must quit the old life, and work for the common good. Her new
      friends were as uncouth and as poor and as hard pressed as herself. In
      their attitude there was none of that maddening condescension, none of
      that supercilious casting of surplus comforts at her feet, as one would
      toss a half-eaten orange toward a hungry-eyed beggar brat, which was the
      only sort of charity Kit had known of hitherto. The friendship of the
      Salvationists was the frank comradeship of plain men and women; their
      charity was the outcome of a crude, but living, religious idea. And their
      wild enthusiasm caught her dull soul in its sweep and lifted it a little
      above the fetid mists of her world. Some latent spark of womanly ambition
      was stirred into life, and with halting, dogged feet she tried to climb
      out of the dank valley of her past.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wearisome task, but the exhilarating sense of friendly interest
      in her success sustained her. The old appetite for strong drink stung her,
      but the excitement of the new life helped to dull the craving. She tramped
      the streets with her companions, her cracked voice shouting quaveringly
      with them as they sang. She stepped sometimes into the little semicircle
      at the street corners to tell excitedly &ldquo;how glad she was that she
      was saved.&rdquo; She knelt with the others and prayed aloud for those who
      were not as she. She was one of a great, enthusiastic army, held up and
      aided by the superficial strength which comes of close fellowship and
      common aims. But with that growth of strength in one quarter there came a
      strange weakness in another. She was growing childishly afraid of Con, and
      with the growth of that fear there started into life and waxed strong a
      new loathing and hatred for his rum-soaked person. She would have fled
      from him, only that her new masters told her she must stick to him. It was
      her duty to cling to him and to &ldquo;save&rdquo; him. Their first
      injunction she obeyed meekly; but to their second command she turned a
      deaf ear. She knew what Con was; they did not. Every human creature in the
      wide world might be saved&mdash;except her husband. He was beyond the pale
      of humanity. So long as she did not bother him, he paid little attention
      to her goings and comings. Only once she ventured to protest when he had
      spent a week&rsquo;s earnings for drink (Con had a &ldquo;pull&rdquo; with
      the ward &ldquo;boss,&rdquo; and when there were no other means of getting
      money for drink he found employment with the street-cleaners), and he had
      knocked her down for her temerity, and after that she held her peace and
      wished dumbly that he might die.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length there came a proud day when Kit, after unwonted labor over her
      wash-tub, was the possessor of a decent black gown and of the long-coveted
      poke bonnet. It was the eve of a great rally at the barracks, when some
      officer of high degree from &ldquo;headquarters&rdquo; was to review the
      ranks of his army. At the close of day, when the long shadows were
      beginning to steal across the bare little room, with its musty bed, its
      one chair, and its rickety table pushed into a corner, Kit crouched upon
      the floor close up under the gray light of her window, intent upon her
      work. There were but a few stitches needed to complete her gown, and her
      stiff fingers fumbled eagerly with the unfamiliar needle. Her thoughts
      were busy with the glories of the morrow, and she crooned one of the
      Salvationist hymns as she sewed. And to her singing in the twilight there
      came the sound of shuffling footsteps outside her door. She looked up
      apprehensively as the door flew open to admit her husband. He was drunk,
      sullenly, brutally drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my supper?&rdquo; he demanded, falling heavily into
      the chair. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my supper, I say?&rdquo; he repeated,
      fixing an evil eye upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it now, Con. I was busy workin&rsquo; on my dress,
      an&rsquo; I clean forgot your supper,&rdquo; she explained, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer dress?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What right&rsquo;s a measly fool
      like you with dresses? Le&rsquo;s see it.&rdquo; He stretched forth his
      hand. She caught the black garment sharply away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll spoil it!&rdquo; she cried, tossing the dress into
      a corner behind the bed. &ldquo;You just set still there, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
      get you somethin&rsquo; to eat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eatin&rsquo; be damned!&rdquo; he replied, surlily. &ldquo;I want
      somethin&rsquo; to drink. Here! you take the can an&rsquo; get somethin&rsquo;
      from Mike&rsquo;s. &lsquo;F you can buy clothes, you can buy drinks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Con, not now. Wait till I get supper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no supper! You rush de can, I tell you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started from his chair and went towards her, but something in her eyes
      made even his sodden senses recoil. He looked at her dubiously a moment,
      and then stumbled out of the room, muttering thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed behind him, the woman sprang for her gown, and,
      dragging it from the corner, slipped it on. A few more stitches were
      needed in it, but she dared not wait to take them. A great terror filled
      her soul. She felt that her husband would return quickly, uglier and
      wilder by a few drams. With shaking fingers she pinned her gown together
      as best she might. She smoothed her scanty, dry, dead hair with her hands,
      and then she lifted her bonnet from the bed. She held it a moment
      admiringly, drawing her fingers softly over its trimmings of dark-blue
      silk, and along its narrow band of scarlet ribbon, where the bright gilt
      letters shone. She put it on her head and tied the soft strings carefully
      under her chin. She glanced hesitatingly at the old plaid shawl, wishing
      that she had a better one, but the night was cold, and she drew it about
      her shoulders. With a little sigh of relief she turned to leave the room.
      As her hand touched the door-latch she heard Con&rsquo;s heavy tread upon
      the stairs. She noted that he staggered a little, and with a quick
      indrawing of her breath she drew herself flat against the wall in the
      shadows. The man threw the door open fiercely, steadying himself against
      the jamb as he peered into the dim room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you, you she-devil?&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman made no sound, and he stepped inside the room, with his broad
      back towards her. Inch by inch she crept along against the wall towards
      the door, as he stood turning from side to side in his maudlin search for
      her, and as her feet touched the threshold he turned and saw her. He
      rushed forward and grabbed her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Givin&rsquo; me the dirty sneak, are you?&rdquo; he growled,
      shoving her inside the room and closing the door. &ldquo;What d&rsquo; yer
      mean? Eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kit made no answer. She backed off, her face gleaming white inside her big
      bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer a nice one, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
      get me nothin&rsquo; to eat or drink, an&rsquo; spendin&rsquo; yer money
      fur clothes, an&rsquo; then tryin&rsquo; to make a sneak! Oh! I was onto
      you all the time! You white-faced fool! What d&rsquo; yer mean? Eh? Damn
      you, what d&rsquo; yer mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Con! Don&rsquo;t hit me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stumbled forward deliberately and struck her upturned face. She
      staggered into the corner by the table, and faced him again. A tiny stream
      of something red trickled down her cheek. Her eyes were suddenly ablaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; get de can filled, that&rsquo;s where yer&rsquo;ll
      go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;<i>never!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A spasm of hate and rage and terror writhed in her face. With the
      quickness of desperation she caught a knife from the table and waited for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lunged towards her with uplifted arm. Before his blow fell she gave one
      swift thrust, and his arm came down simply upon her shoulder. For a moment
      he stood strangely still. He clenched his fist; his teeth were tight; he
      breathed hard through his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then he reeled and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the woman stood there in the gathering gloom, with his blood
      crawling towards her on the floor, she heard the beat of a drum, and the
      sound of voices singing shrilly, far down the street. On they came, nearer
      and louder, until her listening ears heard the thrum of the tambourines.
      Under her window they passed, and away into the night, until at last their
      sound was lost in the ceaseless, sullen tumult of Myrtle Street.

    <h2>
      MANDANY&rsquo;S FOOL
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Maria Louise Pool
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>E ain&rsquo;t got
      hungry for termarters, be ye?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one had knocked at the screen door, and as there was no response, a
      man&rsquo;s strident, good-humored voice put the above question concerning
      tomatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But somebody had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman had been sitting in the kitchen with a pan of seek-no-further
      apples in her lap. She was paring and quartering these and then stabbing
      the quarters through and stringing them on yards of white twine,
      preparatory to festooning them on the clothes-horse which stood in the
      yard. This horse was already decorated profusely in this way. A cloud of
      wasps had flown from the drying fruit as the man walked up the path. He
      swung off his hat and waved the insects away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, have ye got hungry agin for termarters?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rattled the screen; but it was hooked on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and surveyed the three windows that were visible in the bit of a
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t both be gone, &lsquo;n&rsquo; left them apples
      out,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &lsquo;bout sure Ann&rsquo;s
      to home; &lsquo;n&rsquo; she&rsquo;s the one I want to see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman in the bed-room which opened from the kitchen was hurriedly
      smoothing her hair and peering into the glass. She was speaking aloud with
      the air of one who constantly talks to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest as sure&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t comb my hair the first thing,
      somebody comes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a last pat and went to the door. There was a faint smirk on her
      lips and a flush on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tall figure was swayed by a slight, eager tremor as she saw who was
      standing there. She exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me! &lsquo;T ain&rsquo;t you, Mr. Baker, is it? Won&rsquo;t
      ye walk right in? But I don&rsquo;t want no termarters; they always go
      aginst me. Aunt Mandany ain&rsquo;t to home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; was the brisk response. &ldquo;Then I
      guess I will come in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker pushed open the now unfastened door and entered. He set his
      basket of tomatoes with a thump on the rug, and wiped his broad, red face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact is,&rdquo; he said with a grin, &ldquo;I knew she was gone. I
      seen her goin&rsquo; crosst the pastur&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s why I come
      now. I ain&rsquo;t got no longin&rsquo; to see Aunt Mandany&mdash;no,
      sir-ee, not a grain of longin&rsquo; to see her. But I thought &lsquo;t
      would be agreeable to me to clap my eyes on to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman simpered, made an inarticulate sound, and hurriedly resumed her
      seat and her apple-cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you se&rsquo; down, Mr. Baker?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers trembled as she took the darning-needle and jabbed it through
      an apple quarter. The needle went into her flesh also. She gave a little
      cry and thrust her finger into her mouth. Her large, pale eyes turned
      wistfully towards her companion. The faded, already elderly mouth
      quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jest as scar&rsquo;t &lsquo;s I c&rsquo;n be if I see
      blood,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker&rsquo;s heavy under lip twitched; his face softened. But he
      spoke roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t mind that bit er blood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
      won&rsquo;t hurt nothin&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t care if I do se&rsquo; down.
      I ain&rsquo;t drove any this mornin&rsquo;. I c&rsquo;n jest as well as
      not take hold &lsquo;n&rsquo; help ye. I s&rsquo;pose Mandany left a
      thunderin&rsquo; lot for ye to do while she&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two bushels,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old cat! That&rsquo;s too much. But &lsquo;t won&rsquo;t be for
      both of us, will it, Ann?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked for an instant intently at the man who had drawn his chair
      directly opposite her. He was already paring an apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I d&rsquo; know what to make of it,&rdquo; she said, still in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make of what?&rdquo; briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when folks are so good to me &lsquo;s you be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sho&rsquo;, now! Everybody ain&rsquo;t like your Aunt Mandany.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sh! Don&rsquo;t speak so loud! Mebby she&rsquo;ll be comin&rsquo;
      back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t. &lsquo;N&rsquo; no matter if she is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The loud, confident tone rang cheerily in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the silence that followed Mr. Baker watched Ann&rsquo;s deft
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody says you&rsquo;re real capable,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A joyous red covered Ann&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest about do all the work here,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the man again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something curiously sweet in the simple face. The patient line
      at each side of the close, pale mouth had a strange effect upon Mr. Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been known to say violently in conversation at the store that he
      &ldquo;never seen Ann Tracy &lsquo;thout wantin&rsquo; to thrash her Aunt
      Mandany.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in time be you dryin&rsquo; seek-no-further for?&rdquo; he now
      exclaimed with some fierceness. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the flattest kind of
      apples I know of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Aunt says,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;she says
      they&rsquo;re most as flat&rsquo;s as I be, &lsquo;n&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
      flat &lsquo;nough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were pronounced as if the speaker were merely stating a
      well-known fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what does she do um for?&rdquo; persisted Mr. Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says they&rsquo;re good &lsquo;nough to swop for groceries in
      the spring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker made a deep gash in an apple, and held his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ann continued her work, but she took a good deal of seek-no-further with
      the skin in a way that would have shocked Aunt Mandany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she raised her eyes to the sturdy face opposite her and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess your wife had a real good time, didn&rsquo;t she, Mr.
      Baker, when she was livin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker dropped his knife. He glanced up and met the wistful gaze upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that he had thought long dead stirred in his consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I do declare I tried to
      make her have a good time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long&rsquo;s she be&rsquo;n dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Most ten year. We was livin&rsquo; down to Norris Corners
      then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man picked up his knife and absently tried the edge of it on the ball
      of his thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; said Ann, &ldquo;that folks are sorry when
      their wives die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker gave a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall, that depends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, does it? I thought folks had to love their wives, &lsquo;n&rsquo;
      be sorry when they died.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Baker laughed again. He made no other answer for several minutes.
      At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sorry enough when my wife died.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A great pile of quartered apples was heaped up in the wooden bowl before
      either spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ann exclaimed with a piteous intensity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m awful tired of bein&rsquo; Aunt Mandany&rsquo;s fool!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker stamped his foot involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How jew know they call you that?&rdquo; he cried in a great voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Jane Littlefield tell Mis&rsquo; Monk she hoped nobody&rsquo;d
      ask Mandany&rsquo;s fool to the sociable. And Mr. Fletcher&rsquo;s boy
      told me that&rsquo;s what folks called me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn Jane Littlefield! Damn that little devil of a boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These dreadful words burst out furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Ann did not look as shocked as she ought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment she smiled her immature, simple smile that had a touching
      appeal in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T ain&rsquo;t no use denyin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t jes&rsquo; like other folks, &lsquo;n&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
      a fact. I can&rsquo;t think stiddy more &lsquo;n a minute. Things all run
      together, somehow. &lsquo;N&rsquo; the back er my head&rsquo;s odd&rsquo;s
      it can be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! What of it? There can&rsquo;t any of us think stiddy; &lsquo;n&rsquo;
      if we could what would it amount to, I should like to know? It would n&rsquo;t
      amount to a row of pins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ann dropped her work and clasped her hands. Mr. Baker saw that her hands
      were hard, and stained almost black on fingers and thumbs by much cutting
      of apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see,&rdquo; she said, in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;sometimes I
      think if mother had lived she&rsquo;d er treated me so &lsquo;t I could
      think stiddier. I s&rsquo;pose mother&rsquo;d er loved me. They say
      mothers do. But Aunt Mandany told me mother died the year I got my fall
      from the cherry-tree. I was eight then. I don&rsquo;t remember nothin&rsquo;
      &lsquo;bout it, nor &lsquo;bout anything much. Mr. Baker, do you remember
      your mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; abruptly. Something made it impossible
      for him to say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I d&rsquo; know how &lsquo;tis,&rdquo; went on the thin, minor
      voice, &ldquo;but it always did seem to me &lsquo;s though if I could
      remember my mother I could think stiddier, somehow. Do you think I could?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker started to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be dumbed &lsquo;f I c&rsquo;n stan&rsquo; it,&rdquo; he
      shouted. &ldquo;No, nor I won&rsquo;t stan&rsquo; it, nuther!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked noisily across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back and stood in front of Ann, who had patiently resumed work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think a lot of ye. Le&rsquo;s git
      married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ann looked up. She dropped her knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should live with you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so much of confident happiness in that laugh that the man&rsquo;s
      heart glowed youthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be real glad to marry you, Mr. Baker,&rdquo; she said.
      Then, with pride, &ldquo;&lsquo;N&rsquo; I c&rsquo;n cook, &lsquo;n&rsquo;
      I know first rate how to do housework.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet; her eyes shone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker put his arm about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le&rsquo;s go right along now,&rdquo; he said, more quickly than he
      had yet spoken. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call to the minister&rsquo;s &lsquo;n&rsquo;
      engage him. You c&rsquo;n stop there. We&rsquo;ll be married to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t ye wait till I c&rsquo;n put on my bunnit &lsquo;n&rsquo;
      shawl?&rdquo; Ann asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the room. In a few moments she returned dressed for going. She
      had a sheet of note-paper, a bottle of ink, and a pen in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I c&rsquo;n write,&rdquo; she said confidently, &ldquo;&lsquo;n&rsquo;
      I call it fairer to leave word for Aunt Mandany.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the response; &ldquo;go ahead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker said afterward that he never got much more nervous in his life
      than while Ann was writing that note. What if Mandany should appear! He
      wasn&rsquo;t going to back out, but he didn&rsquo;t want to see that
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ink was thick, the pen was like a pin, and Ann was a good while making
      each letter, but the task was at last accomplished. She held out the sheet
      to her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker drew his face down solemnly as he read:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Dere Aunt Mandane:&mdash;

     I&rsquo;m so dretfull Tired of beeing youre fool that ime going
     too be Mr. Baker&rsquo;s. He askt me.

     Ann.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest the thing,&rdquo; he said explosively. &ldquo;Now,
      come on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked along in the hot fall sunshine Mr. Baker said earnestly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain sure we sh&rsquo;ll be ever so much happier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So &lsquo;m I,&rdquo; Ann replied, with cheerful confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on a lonely road, and they walked hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be good to ye,&rdquo; said the man, with
      still more earnestness. Then, in a challenging tone, as if addressing the
      world at large, &ldquo;I guess &lsquo;t ain&rsquo;t nobody&rsquo;s
      business but our&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ann looked at him and smiled trustfully.

    <p>
      After a while he began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; of your Aunt Mandany when she reads that
      letter,&rdquo; he explained.

    <h2>
      THE WAY TO CONSTANTINOPLE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Clinton Ross
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. DENBY poured
      the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, speaking of Constantinople.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Denby blushed. I envied Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have read Gautier, and that is a
      very good monograph of Marion Crawford&rsquo;s. I was there once myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you?&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby, demurely. &ldquo;Do you take
      sugar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tell me!&rdquo; I began, for I saw I was expected to show some
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Dick,&rdquo; began Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only Tom,&rdquo; said Denby, fondly; but not half so
      fondly as he had before he had found her, and persuaded her, and&mdash;I
      always have had such bad luck with the woman whom it&rsquo;s worth while
      trying to marry!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&mdash;it&rsquo;s a silly story. Dick&rsquo;s usually are,&rdquo;
      began Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said Denby. &ldquo;Now, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you must,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby, despairfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris was a glare of splendor that February,&mdash;after the North
      Atlantic,&rdquo; Denby went on. &ldquo;Did you ever leave New York of a
      dismal day of winter fog and a week after find yourself in Havre? The
      boulevards are gay, the shops resplendent. Paris is a different place from
      Paris in July,&mdash;when hordes of our countrymen swoop down on it like
      the Huns. It&rsquo;s like the rural visitor doing Fifth Avenue in August,
      and wondering why New York is so much talked about. But Paris in February
      is the Paris one dreams of when the word is pronounced, with all its
      suggestiveness of the world&rsquo;s gayety. Yet, it was cold that
      February,&mdash;as bitter as in New York; and after coming back one night
      to my lodging on the Avenue Carnot, where the cab was unable to make its
      way because of the frozen sleet on the smooth paving of the hill the
      Avenue des Champs Elysées climbs,&mdash;that night I concluded I had not
      intended exchanging New York for wintry unpleasantness, and decided to go
      to Constantinople. Constantinople, where I had never been, seemed so far
      away, and I did not know that it, too, could be bleakly dismal in the
      spring. The next morning I booked on the Orient Express. That evening I
      was snugly put away in my compartment, and the morning after was looking
      on a Bavarian landscape.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always were impulsive,&rdquo; Mrs. Denby interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; nothing proves that more than my conduct the next morning at
      breakfast in the dining-car. I appeared late. The place was crowded. A
      very pretty girl&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you really think so then?&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I did, or else I shouldn&rsquo;t have taken the seat opposite
      beside a little chap who was ogling and embarrassing her dreadfully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a man&rsquo;s horrid,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw at once he was one of those little Parisians, whose kind I
      know well, who in some way lose their appropriateness when transplanted.
      For I knew at once they were not acquaintances. The girl appeared alone,
      English or American&mdash;I could not be certain. Now, I was sure the man
      was objectionable,&mdash;not quite a gentleman,&mdash;or, if he had been,
      he had distorted the quality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you need n&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby. &ldquo;My
      honest opinion is that you took the seat for exactly the same reason as
      he, because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the girl was pretty?&rdquo; said Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say she was,&rdquo; Mrs. Denby hastened to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I beg pardon, Monsieur,&rsquo; said I to the man, when he
      glared. Presently the Swiss brought the young lady&rsquo;s bill, when a
      strange agitation appeared in my vis-à-vis. I saw and felt for her. She
      had no money. She probably had her ticket, but had lost her purse. She did
      not attempt to go back to the Wagon Lit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am going to Constantinople,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I beg pardon, Madame,&rsquo; began the Swiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cannot the bill&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am sorry, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; said the Swiss, and he
      looked desolated, with a contrary gleam in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here the man by my side dropped from the category of the gentleman
      to that of the cad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If Mademoiselle will allow me,&rsquo; he began eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leaned under the table, pretending to pick up a purse, which I
      really took from my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I think this is your purse,&rsquo; I said in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For an instant she scanned me. The Frenchman looked daggers. She
      was blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said she, and I knew she was an American;
      &lsquo;how stupid of me to have dropped it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from my purse she paid the bill, nodded to me, ignoring the
      Frenchman, and without further word left the buffet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The particular French cad evidently wanted to pick a quarrel with
      me, and for a moment I was debating with myself whether I might not have
      been an ass. A fool&rsquo;s money goes the way of his scanty wit. The girl
      might appear pretty, innocent, attractive&mdash;and yet&mdash;I swallowed
      my coffee, and returned to my compartment, which I had to myself. The door
      was open. Presently I saw the young woman of the breakfast-table walking
      up and down the aisle. I was determined I should not notice her. Suddenly
      I heard her voice at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sir, what can you think of me? But I couldn&rsquo;t help it,
      really,&mdash;I have lost my purse. Here is yours; I will return the six
      francs at Constantinople.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a tear; and I was sure my knowledge of femininity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conceited,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could not be at fault,&rdquo; Denby continued. &ldquo;I bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be able to make the loan&mdash;&rsquo; I
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s good of you,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But if you have lost all your money, I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How can you avoid borrowing more?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That man at the table made me feel so detestably,&rsquo; she
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, you must n&rsquo;t mind!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And you really are so nice&mdash;What do you know about me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I can tell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I think you generally can,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that interesting?&rsquo; said I, pointing out of
      the window at some peasants in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, yes!&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;May I sit down?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had reached her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, certainly, I shall be glad to have you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How does it happen&mdash;&rsquo; I began after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s your purse,&rsquo; she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now, really, please. It won&rsquo;t inconvenience me in the
      least. There are only five louis there, and I have my portemonnaie
      besides, and&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I believe I said I should be delighted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo; Oh, you did, but you began a&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said I, feeling uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A question. I know what it was.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if you do&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m from Illinois. We don&rsquo;t regard chaperones as
      so necessary; besides&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Besides?&rsquo; I could n&rsquo;t resist saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I believe women should take care of themselves.&rsquo;
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But they can&rsquo;t&mdash;always.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You mean&mdash;&rsquo; she began rather indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;they sometimes have to borrow, you
      know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s mean of you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&mdash;I beg pardon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t. I wish I could return your six francs. I
      am going to Constantinople to meet my father, who is up from the east. I
      went all alone&mdash;because&mdash;there was nobody.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t mind
      me, please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looked at me then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose I shall have to tolerate you. You are the only
      American on this train.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I consider myself your guardian,&mdash;with letters
      testamentary.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am forced to it,&rsquo; said she, but smiling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, she did n&rsquo;t smile,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is deliciously lucky. I
      thought I should have this ride alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this moment&mdash;for some time had passed&mdash;the Swiss
      announced luncheon, which she&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How horridly forward it all sounds,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which she took with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, I wonder at it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had to,&rdquo; said Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, you had the money,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she tolerated&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the word, I think,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We walked the station at Vienna. We took an ice at Buda-Pesth. We
      wondered about Queen Nathalie at Belgrade. We bought beads at Sofia. We
      shivered over the Bulgarian soldiers squatting on the platform against
      Turkish banditti. I told her how an Orient Express had been held up the
      autumn before, a Frankfort banker abstracted, and his ears sent to his
      counting-house with a request for a gold payment or else his tongue would
      follow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was horrid of you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at Constantinople, her father was not there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was terrible,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I knew the American Consul&rsquo;s wife, who took in the
      situation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very nice of her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We roamed about the Pera; sentimentalized in San Sofia; bargained&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your money,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the bazaars. We rode in a palanquin, and drove to the Sweet
      Waters of Europe, danced at the Russian Legation,&mdash;where she was
      irresistible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eyes!&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby, with severe sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day her father appeared. She counted out three louis&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And five francs sixty centimes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t all,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, let me see,&rsquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t all,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my
      heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very silly speech&mdash;not at all original,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Denby. &ldquo;I should think you would be ashamed to repeat it&mdash;before
      visitors. But, Mr. Pemberton, you haven&rsquo;t told me whether you take
      sugar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sugar, thanks,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good story. It
      reminds me of an episode in Hunter&rsquo;s novel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a better story,&rdquo; said Denby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; said Mrs. Denby, looking at him with sudden
      earnestness. &ldquo;Do you mean that&mdash;now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt, as is often the case lately, the superfluous bachelor. I went to
      call on Sally Waters.

      THE OLD PARTISAN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Octave Thanet
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> SAT so far back
      in the gallery that my opinion of my delegate friend dwindled with every
      session. Nevertheless my unimportant seat had its advantages. I could see
      the vast assembly and watch the throbbing of the Republican pulse if I
      could not hear its heartbeats. Therefore, perhaps, I studied my neighbors
      more than I might study them under different circumstances. The great
      wooden hall had its transient and unsubstantial character stamped on every
      bare wooden joist and unclinched nail. It was gaudy with flags and bunting
      and cheap portraits. There were tin bannerets crookedly marshalled on the
      floor, to indicate the homes of the different States. A few delegates,
      doubtless new to the business and overzealous, were already on the floor,
      but none of the principals were visible. They were perspiring and arguing
      in those committee rooms, those hotel lobbies and crowded hotel rooms
      where the real business of the convention was already done and neatly
      prepared for presentation to the nation. I had nothing to keep me from
      studying my neighbors. In front of me sat two people who had occupied the
      same seats at every session that I was present, a young girl and an old
      man. The girl wore the omnipresent shirtwaist (of pretty blue and white
      tints, with snowy cuffs and collar), and her green straw hat was decked
      with blue corn-flowers, from which I inferred that she had an eye on the
      fashions. Her black hair was thick and glossy under the green straw. I
      thought that she had a graceful neck. It was very white. Whiter than her
      face, which had a touch of sunburn, as if she were often out in the open
      air. Somehow I concluded that she was a shop-girl and rode a wheel. If I
      were wrong it is not likely that I shall ever know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man I fancied was not so old as he looked; his delicate, haggard
      profile may have owed its sunken lines and the dim eye to sickness rather
      than to years. He wore the heavy black broadcloth of the rural politician,
      and his coat sagged over his narrow chest as if he had left his waistcoat
      at home. On his coat lapel were four old-fashioned Blaine badges.
      Incessantly he fanned himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be they ain&rsquo;t going to nominate him to-day?&rdquo;
      he asked rather than asserted, his voice breaking on the higher notes, the
      mere wreck of a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, maybe later,&rdquo; the girl reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wanted to attend a Republican convention once more before I
      died. Your ma would have it I wasn&rsquo;t strong enough; but I knew
      better; you and I knew better; did n&rsquo;t we, Jenny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer except to pat his thin, ribbed brown hand with her
      soft, white, slim one; but there was a world of sympathy in the gesture
      and her silent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what your ma said when she came downstairs and found the
      letter, and us gone,&rdquo; he cackled with the garrulous glee of a child
      recounting successful mischief; &ldquo;made me think of the times when you
      was little and I stole you away for the circus. Once, your pa thought you
      was lost&mdash;&lsquo;member? And once, you had on your school-dress and
      you&rsquo;d tore it&mdash;she did scold you that time. But we had fun when
      they used to let me have money, did n&rsquo;t we, Jenny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now I earn money, we have good times, too, grandpa,&rdquo;
      said Jenny, smiling the same tender, comprehending smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do that; I don&rsquo;t know what I would do &lsquo;cept for you,
      lambie, and this is&mdash;this is a grand time, Jenny, you look and
      listen; it&rsquo;s a great thing to see a nation making its principles and
      its president&mdash;and such a president!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He half turned his head as he spoke, with a mounting enthusiasm, thus
      bringing his flushing face and eager eyes&mdash;no longer dim&mdash;into
      the focus of his next neighbor&rsquo;s bright gray eyes. The neighbor was
      a young man, not very young but hardly to be called elderly, of an alert
      bearing and kindly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think him a pretty fair man myself,&rdquo; said the other with a
      jocose understatement; &ldquo;I come from his town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What was there in such a simple statement to bring a distinctly anxious
      look into the young girl&rsquo;s soft eyes? There it was; one could not
      mistake it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the old man; there was a flattering deference in
      his voice. &ldquo;Well, well. And&mdash;and maybe you&rsquo;ve seen him
      lately?&rdquo; The quavering tones sharpened with a keener feeling; it was
      almost as if the man were inquiring for some one on whom he had a great
      stake of affection. &ldquo;How did he look? Was he better, stronger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he looked elegant,&rdquo; said the Ohio man, easily, but with a
      disconcerted side glance at the girl whose eyes were imploring him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a Blaine man ever since he was run, the time Bob
      Ingersoll nominated him,&rdquo; said the old man, who sighed as if
      relieved. &ldquo;I was at that convention and heard the speech&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was a speech to hear,&rdquo; said a man behind, and two or
      three men edged their heads nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Republican straightened his bent shoulders, his winter-stung
      features softened and warmed at the manifestation of interest, his voice
      sank to the confidential undertone of the narrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, sir, right; it was a magnificent speech. I can
      see him jest as he stood there, a stoutish, good-looking man,
      smooth-faced, his eye straight ahead, and an alternate that sat next me&mdash;I
      was an alternate; I&rsquo;ve been an alternate four times; I could have
      been a delegate, but I says, &lsquo;No, abler men than me are wanting it;
      I&rsquo;m willing to fight in the ranks.&rsquo; But I wished I had a vote,
      a free vote that day, I tell you. The alternate near me, he says, &lsquo;You
      &lsquo;ll hear something fine now; I&rsquo;ve heard him speak.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, too, I guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could hear from the first minute. That kinder fixed our
      attention. He had a mellow, rich kind of voice that melted into our ears.
      We found ourselves listening and liking him from the first sentence. At
      first he was as quiet as a summer breeze, but presently he began to warm
      up, and the words flowed out like a stream of jewels. It was electrifying:
      it was thrilling, sir; it took us off our feet before we knew it, and when
      he came to the climax, those of us that weren&rsquo;t yelling in the
      aisles were jumping up and down on our chairs! I know I found myself
      prancing up and down in my own hat on a chair, swinging somebody else&rsquo;s
      hat and screaming at the top of my voice, with the tears running down my
      cheeks. God! sir, there were men there on their feet cheering their
      throats out that had to vote against him afterwards&mdash;had to because
      they were there instructed&mdash;no more free will than a checked trunk!&rdquo;
      The light died out of his face. &ldquo;Yes, sir, a great speech; never a
      greater ever made at a convention anywhere, never so great a speech,
      whoever made it: but it did no good, he wasn&rsquo;t nominated, and when
      we did nominate him we were cheated out of our victory. Well, we &lsquo;ll
      do better this day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will that,&rdquo; said the other man, heartily; &ldquo;McKinley&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me&mdash;&rdquo; the old man struck in with a
      deprecating air, yet under the apology something fiercely eager and
      anxious that glued the hearer&rsquo;s eyes to his quivering old face&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
      excuse me. I&mdash;I am a considerable of an invalid and I don&rsquo;t
      keep the run of things as I used to. You see I live with my daughter, and
      you know how women folks are, fretting lest things should make you sick,
      and my girl she worries so, me reading the papers. Fact is I got a shock
      once, an awful shock,&rdquo; he shivered involuntarily and his dim eyes
      clouded, &ldquo;and it worried her seeing me read. Hadn&rsquo;t ought to;
      it don&rsquo;t worry Jenny here, who often gets me a paper, quiet like;
      but you know how it is with women&mdash;it&rsquo;s easier giving them
      their head a little&mdash;and so I don&rsquo;t see many papers, and I
      kinder dropped off. It seems queer, but I don&rsquo;t exactly sense it
      about this McKinley. Is he running against Blaine or jest for vice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, under some feminine pretext of dropping and reaching for her
      handkerchief, threw upward a glance of appeal at the interlocutor.
      Hurriedly she stepped into the conversation. &ldquo;My grandfather read a
      false report about&mdash;about Mr. Blaine&rsquo;s sickness, and he was not
      well at the time and it brought on a bad attack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the listener, with a grave nod of his
      head and movement of his eyes in the girl&rsquo;s direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about McKinley?&rdquo; the old man persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s for vice-president,&rdquo; the girl announced, her eyes
      fixed on the hesitating man from Canton. I have often admired the intrepid
      fashion in which a woman will put her conscience at a moral hedge, while a
      man of no finer spiritual fibre will be straining his eyes to find a hole
      through which he can crawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McKinley is not opposed to Blaine, is he?&rdquo; she asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Republican party has no name that is more loved than that of
      James G. Blaine,&rdquo; said the man, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, that&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; the old partisan assented
      eagerly; &ldquo;to my mind he&rsquo;s the logical candidate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canton man nodded, and asked if he had ever seen Blaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, only once. I was on a delegation sent to wait on him and ask
      him to our town to speak&mdash;he was in Cincinnati. I held out my hand
      when my turn came, and the chairman nearly knocked the breath out of me by
      saying, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the man gave more to our campaign fund and
      worked harder than any man in the county, and we all worked hard for you,
      too.&rsquo; Well, Mr. Blaine looked at me. You know the intent way he
      looks. He has the most wonderful eyes; look right at you and seem to bore
      into you like a gimlet. I felt as if he was looking right down into my
      soul, and I tell you I was glad, for I choked up so I couldn&rsquo;t find
      a word, not a word, and I was ready and fluent enough in those days, too,
      I can tell you; but I stood there filling up, and squeezed his hand and
      gulped and got red, like a fool. But he understood. &lsquo;I have heard of
      your loyalty to Republican principles, Mr. Painter,&rsquo; says he, in
      that beautiful voice of his that was like a violin; and I burst in&mdash;I
      could n&rsquo;t help it&mdash;&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t loyalty to Republican
      principles, it&rsquo;s to you.&rsquo; I said that right out. And he
      smiled, and said he, &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s wrong, but it isn&rsquo;t
      for me to quarrel with you there, Mr. Painter,&rsquo; and then they pushed
      me along: but twice while the talk was going on I saw him look my way and
      caught his eye, and he smiled, and when we were all shaking hands for
      good-bye he shook hands with a good firm grip, and said he, &lsquo;Good-bye,
      Mr. Painter; I hope we shall meet again.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man drew a long sigh. &ldquo;Those few moments paid for
      everything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen him since. I&rsquo;ve
      been sick and lost money. I ain&rsquo;t the man I was. I never shall be
      put on any delegation again, or be sent to any convention; but I thought
      if I could only go once more to a Republican convention and hear them
      holler for Blaine, and holler once more myself, I&rsquo;d be willinger to
      die. And I told Tom Hale that, and he and Jenny raised the money. Yes,
      Jenny, I&rsquo;m going to tell&mdash;he and Jenny put off being married a
      bit so &lsquo;s I could go, and go on plenty of money. Jenny, she worked a
      month longer to have plenty, and Tom, he slipped ten dollars into my hand
      unbeknown to her, jest as we were going, so I&rsquo;d always have a dime
      to give the waiter or the porter. I was never one of these hayseed farmers
      too stingy to give a colored boy a dime when he&rsquo;d done his best. I
      didn&rsquo;t need no money for badges; I got my old badges&mdash;see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed out the lapel of his coat, covered with those old-fashioned
      frayed bits of tinsel and ribbon, smiling confidently. The girl had
      flushed crimson to the rim of her white collar; but there was not a trace
      of petulance in her air; and, all at once looking at him, her eyes filled
      with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s an awful good fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an awful
      good fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that,&rdquo; said the Canton man, with the frank
      American friendliness, making a little bow in Miss Jenny&rsquo;s
      direction; &ldquo;but see here, Mr. Painter, do you come from Izard? Are
      you the man that saved the county for the Republicans, by mortgaging his
      farm and then going on a house to house canvass?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; the old man acquiesced, blushing with
      pleasure; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think, though, that it was known outside&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things go further than you guess. I&rsquo;m a newspaper man, and I
      can tell you that I shall speak of it again in my paper. Well, I guess
      they&rsquo;ve got through with their mail, and the platform&rsquo;s coming
      in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he brushed aside the old man&rsquo;s agitated thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;who&mdash;who&rsquo;s
      going to nominate him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the space of an eyeblink the kindly Canton man looked embarrassed,
      then he said, briskly: &ldquo;Foraker, Foraker of Ohio&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      the principal one. That&rsquo;s he now, chairman of the committee on
      resolutions. He&rsquo;s there, the tall man with the mustache&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that elderly man, with the stoop shoulders and the chin
      beard and caved-in face, Teller?&rdquo; It was a man near me, on the seat
      behind, who spoke, tapping the Canton man with his fan, to attract
      attention; already the pitiful concerns of the old man who was &ldquo;a
      little off&rdquo; (as I had heard some one on the seat whisper) were
      sucked out of notice in the whirlpool of the approaching political storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Teller,&rdquo; answered the Canton man, his mouth
      straightening and growing thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it to be a bolt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canton man nodded, at which the other whistled and communicated the
      information to his neighbors, one of whom remarked, &ldquo;Let &lsquo;em
      bolt and be d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; A subtle excitement seemed to
      communicate its vibrations to all the gallery. Perhaps I should except the
      old partisan; he questioned the girl in a whisper, and then, seeming to be
      satisfied, watched the strange scene that ensued with an expression of
      patient weariness. The girl explained parts of the platform to him and he
      assented; it was good Republican doctrine, he said, but what did they mean
      with all this talk against the money; were they having trouble with the
      mining States again? The Canton man stopped to explain&mdash;he certainly
      was good-humored.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next twenty minutes, filled as they were with savage emotion,
      while the galleries, like the floor, were on their chairs yelling,
      cheering, brandishing flags and fists and fans and pampas plumes of red,
      white, and blue at the little band of silver men who marched through the
      ranks of their former comrades, he stood, he waved his fan in his feeble
      old hand, but he did not shout. &ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right on the money question, but I&rsquo;m saving my
      voice to shout for <i>him!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the Canton man; but he took
      occasion to cast a backward glance which I met, and it said as plainly as
      a glance can speak, &ldquo;I wish I were out of this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, with an absent but happy smile, the old Blaine man was beating
      time to the vast waves of sound that rose and swelled above the band,
      above the cheering, above the cries of anger and scorn, the tremendous
      chorus that had stiffened men&rsquo;s hearts as they marched to death and
      rung through streets filled with armies and thrilled the waiting hearts at
      home:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Three cheers for the red, white, and blue!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Three cheers for the red, white, and blue!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The army and navy forever, three cheers for the
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      red, white, and blue!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the chairman had stilled the tumult and made his grim comment,
      &ldquo;There appear to be enough delegates left to transact business,&rdquo;
      the old partisan cast his eyes down to the floor with a chuckle. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t see the hole they made, it&rsquo;s so small. Say, ain&rsquo;t
      he a magnificent chairman; you can hear every word he says!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully chairman,&rdquo; said a cheerful &ldquo;rooter&rdquo; in the
      rear, who had enjoyed the episode more than words can say, and had cheered
      the passing of Silver with such choice quotations from popular songs as
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my lover, good-bye,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Just tell them that
      you saw me,&rdquo; and plainly felt that he, too, had adorned the moment.
      &ldquo;I nearly missed coming this morning, and I would n&rsquo;t have
      missed it for a tenner; they&rsquo;re going to nominate now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man caught his breath; then he smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you
      shout pretty soon,&rdquo; said he, while he sat down very carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;rooter,&rdquo; a good-looking young fellow with a Reed button
      and three or four gaudy badges decking his crash coat, nodded and tapped
      his temple furtively, still retaining his expression of radiant
      good-nature. The Canton man nodded and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that the Canton man need not be afraid. Somehow we were all tacitly
      taking care that this poor, bewildered soul should not have its little
      dream of loyal, unselfish satisfaction dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my countrymen,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;you do a hundred crazy
      things, you crush <i>les convenances</i> under foot, you can be fooled by
      frantic visionaries&mdash;but how I love you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Baldwin of Iowa that made the first speech. He was one of the very
      few men&mdash;I had almost said of the two men&mdash;that we in the
      galleries had the pleasure of hearing; and we could hear every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began with a glowing tribute to Blaine. At the first sentence, our old
      man flung his gray head in the air with the gesture of the war horse when
      he catches the first, far-off scream of the trumpet. He leaned forward,
      his features twitching, his eyes burning; the fan dropped out of his limp
      hand; his fingers, rapping his palm, clenched and loosened themselves
      unconsciously in an overpowering agitation. His face was white as marble,
      with ominous blue shadows; but every muscle was astrain; his chest
      expanded; his shoulders drew back; his mouth was as strong and firm as a
      young man. For a second we could see what he had been at his prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the orator&rsquo;s climax came, and the name&mdash;the magic name
      that was its own campaign cry in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old partisan leaped to his feet; he waved his hands above his head;
      wild, strange, in his white flame of excitement. He shouted; and we all
      shouted with him, the McKinley man and the Reed man vying with each other
      (I here offer my testimony to the scope and quality of that young Reed man&rsquo;s
      voice), and the air rang about us: &ldquo;Blaine! Blaine! James G. Blaine!&rdquo;
      He shrieked the name again and again, goading into life the waning
      applause. Then in an instant his will snapped under the strain; his gray
      beard tilted in the air; his gray head went back on his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canton man and I caught him in time to ease the fall. We were helped
      to pull him into the aisle. There were four of us by this time, his
      granddaughter and the Reed &ldquo;rooter,&rdquo; besides the Canton man
      and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We carried him into the wide passageway that led to the seats. The Reed
      young man ran for water, and, finding none, quickly returned with a glass
      of lemonade (he was a young fellow ready in shifts), and with it we bathed
      the old man&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he came back, by degrees, to the world; he was not conscious,
      but we could see that he was not going to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right in no time,&rdquo; declared the Reed man.
      &ldquo;You had better go back and get your seats, and keep mine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured both men that I could not return for more than a short time,
      having an engagement for luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the Reed man, turning to the
      Canton man, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t shouting when Foraker comes; you are. You
      go back and keep my seat; I&rsquo;ll come in later on Hobart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the kindly Canton man returned to the convention for which he was
      longing, and we remained in our little corner by the window, the young
      girl fanning the old man, and the young man on the watch for a boy with
      water. He darted after one; and then the girl turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one disturbed us. Below, the traffic of a great city roared up to us
      and a brass band clanged merrily. The crowd hurried past, drawn by the
      tidings that &ldquo;the light was on,&rdquo; it choked the outlets and
      suffocated the galleries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been that way ever since he read, suddenly, that Blaine
      was dead,&rdquo; she said, lowering her voice to keep it safe from his
      failing ears; &ldquo;he had a kind of a stroke, and ever since he &lsquo;s
      had the notion that Blaine was alive and was going to be nominated, and
      his heart was set on going here. Mother was afraid; but when&mdash;when he
      cried to go, I could not help taking him&mdash;I did n&rsquo;t know but
      maybe it might help him; he was such a smart man and such a good man; and
      he has had trouble about mortgaging the farm; and he worked so hard to get
      the money back, so mother would feel right. All through the hot weather he
      worked, and I guess that&rsquo;s how it happened. You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
      hurt him? The doctor said he might go. He told T&mdash;&mdash;, a
      gentleman friend of mine who asked him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it has been good for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked for her address, which fortunately was near, and I offered her the
      cab that was waiting for me. I had some ado to persuade her to accept it;
      but when I pointed to her grandfather&rsquo;s pale face she did accept it,
      thanking me in a simple but touching way, and, of course, begging me to
      visit her at Izard, Ohio.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while we had been sedulously fanning the old man, who would
      occasionally open his eyes for a second, but gave no other sign of
      returning consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Reed man came back with the water. He was bathing the old man&rsquo;s
      forehead in a very skilful and careful way, using my handkerchief, when an
      uproar of cheering shook the very floor under us and the rafters overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; the old man inquired, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foraker! Foraker!&rdquo; bellowed the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nominated him!&rdquo; muttered the old man; but this
      time he did not attempt to rise. With a smile of great content he leaned
      against his granddaughter&rsquo;s strong young frame and listened, while
      the cheers swelled into a deafening din, an immeasurable tumult of sound,
      out of which a few strong voices shaped the chorus of the Battle Cry of
      Freedom, to be caught up by fifteen thousand throats and pealed through
      the walls far down the city streets to the vast crowd without.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Reed &ldquo;boomer,&rdquo; carried away by the moment, flung his
      free hand above his head and yelled defiantly: &ldquo;Three cheers for the
      man from Maine!&rdquo; Instantly he caught at his wits, his color turned,
      and he lifted an abashed face to the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, really, you know, that ain&rsquo;t giving nothing away,&rdquo;
      he apologized, plucking up heart. &ldquo;May I do it again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old partisan&rsquo;s eye lighted. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re shouting!
      That&rsquo;s like old times! Yes, do it again, boy! Blaine! Blaine! James
      G. Blaine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He let us lead him to the carriage, the rapturous smile still on his lips.
      The &ldquo;rooter&rdquo; and I wormed our way through the crowd back to
      the seats which the kind Canton man had kept for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were quite like old acquaintances now; and he turned to me at once,
      &ldquo;Was there ever a politician or a statesman, since Henry Clay, loved
      so well as James G. Blaine?&rdquo;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
